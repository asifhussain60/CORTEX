The cycle must be followed: RED (failing test), GREEN (implementation), REFACTOR (improvement). Those who bypass this sacred cycle invite chaos into their realm.</p> <p>DEFINITION_OF_DONE - The Standard of Completion No work shall be deemed complete whilst errors persist or warnings cry out for attention. Zero errors, zero warnings - this is the law. Only when all validation passes may one claim victory.</p> <p>DEFINITION_OF_READY - Prerequisites for Commencement Before any work begins, requirements must be documented, dependencies identified, technical design approved, and test strategy defined. To proceed without preparation is to court disaster.</p> <p>BRAIN_PROTECTION_TESTS_MANDATORY - Guardian of Core Integrity The brain protection tests are sacred sentinels that must never fail. They validate path handling, protection logic, conversation tracking, and configuration loading. A 100% pass rate is not a goal but a covenant - any failure blocks all work until resolved.</p> <p>MACHINE_READABLE_FORMATS - The Principle of Efficiency Use YAML for structured data, JSON for metrics, code files for examples. Reserve Markdown for user-facing narratives only. Machine-readable formats reduce tokens by 60% and prevent documentation drift.</p> <p>CORTEX_PROMPT_FILE_PROTECTION - Stability of the Entry Point The file CORTEX.prompt.md must never be renamed. It is the single entry point for GitHub Copilot integration. To rename it is to break the covenant. Updates must follow the sacred procedure: create temporary file, clear original, copy content, delete temporary.</p>"},{"location":"#layer-ii-tier-boundary-protection","title":"\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Layer II: Tier Boundary Protection","text":"<p>The Organization of Knowledge</p> <p>TIER0_APPLICATION_DATA - Immutability of Governance Tier 0 contains only generic CORTEX principles, never application-specific data.

Each agent must have a single, well-defined responsibility. When tempted to add \"modes\" or \"switches,\" create a dedicated agent instead.</p> <p>DEPENDENCY_INVERSION - Flexibility Through Abstraction Hardcoded paths and fixed dependencies are the enemies of maintainability. Use dependency injection, load from configuration, pass as parameters. Never embed absolutes into the fabric of the code.</p> <p>OPEN_CLOSED - Extension Over Modification When behavior must change, extend through new implementations rather than modifying existing ones. Use strategy patterns, decorators, and wrappers. Keep the foundation stable while building upward.</p> <p>CODE_STYLE_CONSISTENCY - Harmony in Expression Generated code must blend seamlessly with the existing codebase. Match indentation, naming conventions, bracket styles, and documentation formats. But never compromise on best practices - SOLID principles and security trump style preferences.</p>"},{"location":"#layer-iv-hemisphere-specialization","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Layer IV: Hemisphere Specialization","text":"<p>The Division of Labor</p> <p>LEFT_BRAIN_TACTICAL - Execution Without Planning The left hemisphere executes but does not plan.

Verify the actual execution path from A \u2192 B \u2192 C. Configuration alone proves nothing.</p> <p>SKULL-003: Visual Regression - CSS changes require visual validation CSS and UI changes must be validated visually in the browser, with computed styles verified. Cache must be cleared. Before/after screenshots are required.</p> <p>SKULL-004: Retry Without Learning - Diagnose before repeating When a fix fails, diagnose the root cause before retrying. Never apply the same fix multiple times without understanding why it failed. Change approach based on diagnosis.</p> <p>SKULL-005: Transformation Verification - Operations claiming transformation must produce changes If an operation claims to transform files, the file hash must differ before and after. Git diff must show modifications. Pass-through operations must not claim transformation success.</p> <p>SKULL-006: Privacy Protection - No machine-specific data in published packages Published packages must contain no absolute paths (C:\\, D:\\, /home/, /Users/), no machine names (AHHOME), no log files, no coverage artifacts, no health reports. Use template configs with placeholders.</p> <p>SKULL-007: Faculty Integrity - Published CORTEX must be fully operational Published packages must contain all essential faculties: all four tiers (Tier 0-3), all ten specialist agents, operations framework, plugin system, entry points, and user documentation.

Validate before splitting work.</p> <p>SKULL-009: Track Work Isolation - Stay within assigned boundaries When working on Track A, only modify modules assigned to Track A. Cross-track modifications break parallel development guarantees and create merge conflicts during consolidation.</p> <p>SKULL-010: Consolidation Integrity - Merge without data loss Track consolidation must preserve all progress from all tracks.
