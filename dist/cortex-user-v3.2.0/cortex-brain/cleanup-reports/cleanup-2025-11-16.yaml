changes:
  prompt_file:
    file: .github/prompts/CORTEX.prompt.md
    change: Added rule to never create end-of-task summary documents

      - Deprecated backup creation (use git instead)
      - Added cleanup_backup_folders() method

  deleted_folders:
    count: 15
    pattern: docs-backup-*
    dates: 20251115 (15 backups from single day)
    reason: Redundant with git history

policies_established:
  - name: No End-of-Task Summaries
    rule: Copilot will not create markdown summary documents after completing tasks
    exception: Machine-readable YAML in cortex-brain/ if needed for system processing
    location: .github/prompts/CORTEX.prompt.md line 100
    
  - name: No docs-backup Folders
    rule: Cleanup module prevents creation of docs-backup folders
    alternative: Use git for version history
    implementation: src/epm/modules/cleanup_manager.py
    
  - name: Referential MD Deletion
    rule: Delete completion reports, summaries, and session documents from root and temp folders
    location: These create clutter and are not actual documentation
    exception: Keep organized historical reports in cortex-brain/documents/ structure
    
  - name: Historical Reports Policy
    rule: Keep existing completion reports in cortex-brain/documents/ (41 reports, 6 summaries)
    reason: Valuable historical context and learning value
    future: Optional YAML indexing for machine-queryability (low priority)

verification:
  docs_backup_folders_remaining: 0

  - Run cleanup module regularly to remove any new docs-backup folders
  - Consider scripted cleanup of remaining referential MDs in cortex-brain/archives
