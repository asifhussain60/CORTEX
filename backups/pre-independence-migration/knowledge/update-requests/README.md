# Update Requests

This folder contains requests to update stale documentation, generated by the `knowledge-retriever` agent.

## How It Works

When you ask KDS a question (via `ask-kds.md`), the `knowledge-retriever` agent validates documentation freshness. If stale content is detected, an update request is automatically created here.

## Request Format

Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-{issue-summary}.md`

## Status

Each request has a status:
- **PENDING_REVIEW**: Awaiting governance review
- **APPROVED**: Ready for implementation
- **IN_PROGRESS**: Being updated
- **COMPLETED**: Documentation updated
- **REJECTED**: Won't fix (with rationale)

## Governance

Update requests are reviewed by the `change-governor` agent per Rule #6.

---

**Governed By**: Rule #14 (Publishing Mechanism), Rule #6 (Change Governance)
