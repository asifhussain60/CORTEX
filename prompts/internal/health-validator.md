## 🔍 Health Checks

### 0. Portability Configuration Validation (NEW)

**Purpose:** Verify that `kds.config.json` is properly configured for the current project.

```powershell
# Check if config file exists
$configPath = "KDS/kds.config.json"
IF (Test-Path $configPath):
  ✅ Configuration file found
ELSE:
  ❌ Configuration file missing
  RECOMMENDATION: Create from template: KDS/templates/kds.config.template.json
  HALT

# Load and validate JSON
$config = Get-Content $configPath -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json
IF (valid JSON):
  ✅ Valid JSON syntax
ELSE:
  ❌ Invalid JSON syntax
  RECOMMENDATION: Validate at https://jsonlint.com/
  HALT

# Validate required fields
REQUIRED_FIELDS = [
  "application.name",
  "application.framework", 
  "application.language",
  "application.rootPath",
  "governance.autoChainTasks",
  "governance.autoChainPhases",
  "governance.testQualityThreshold"
]

FOR each field in REQUIRED_FIELDS:
  IF field exists and not empty:
    ✅ {field} present
  ELSE:
    ❌ Missing required field: {field}
    RECOMMENDATION: Add field to kds.config.json

# Validate paths exist
$rootPath = $config.application.rootPath
IF (Test-Path $rootPath):
  ✅ Root path exists: {rootPath}
ELSE:
  ❌ Root path does not exist: {rootPath}
  RECOMMENDATION: Update application.rootPath with correct absolute path

# Validate commands are executable (if configured)
$buildCmd = $config.application.buildCommand
IF ($buildCmd -and $buildCmd -ne ""):
  TRY:
    # Test command exists (don't run, just check it's valid)
    $cmdName = ($buildCmd -split ' ')[0]
    Get-Command $cmdName -ErrorAction Stop
    ✅ Build command executable: {buildCmd}
  CATCH:
    ⚠️ Build command may not be executable: {buildCmd}
    RECOMMENDATION: Verify command is in PATH

$runCmd = $config.application.runCommand
IF ($runCmd -and $runCmd -ne ""):
  TRY:
    $cmdName = ($runCmd -split ' ')[0]
    Get-Command $cmdName -ErrorAction Stop
    ✅ Run command executable: {runCmd}
  CATCH:
    ⚠️ Run command may not be executable: {runCmd}
    RECOMMENDATION: Verify command is in PATH

# Validate test configuration (if configured)
$testFramework = $config.testing.framework
IF ($testFramework -and $testFramework -ne "None"):
  ✅ Test framework configured: {testFramework}
  
  $testConfigPath = Join-Path $rootPath $config.testing.configPath
  IF ($config.testing.configPath -and (Test-Path $testConfigPath)):
    ✅ Test config file exists: {testConfigPath}
  ELSE IF ($config.testing.configPath):
    ⚠️ Test config file not found: {testConfigPath}
    RECOMMENDATION: Update testing.configPath or create config file
  
  $testCmd = $config.testing.testCommand
  IF ($testCmd):
    TRY:
      $cmdName = ($testCmd -split ' ')[0]
      Get-Command $cmdName -ErrorAction Stop
      ✅ Test command executable: {testCmd}
    CATCH:
      ⚠️ Test command may not be executable: {testCmd}
      RECOMMENDATION: Install test framework or update PATH
  
  $healthUrl = $config.testing.healthCheckUrl
  IF ($healthUrl):
    ℹ️ Health check URL configured: {healthUrl}
    NOTE: URL accessibility check skipped (app may not be running)
ELSE:
  ℹ️ No test framework configured

# Validate database configuration (if configured)
$dbProvider = $config.database.provider
IF ($dbProvider -and $dbProvider -ne "None"):
  ✅ Database provider configured: {dbProvider}
  
  $connKey = $config.database.connectionStringKey
  IF ($connKey):
    ✅ Connection string key: {connKey}
  ELSE:
    ⚠️ No connection string key configured
    RECOMMENDATION: Set database.connectionStringKey
ELSE:
  ℹ️ No database configured

# Determine portability status
IF (all required fields present AND rootPath exists):
  IF (no command errors AND no config warnings):
    ✅ PORTABILITY: Fully configured
  ELSE IF (warnings only):
    ⚠️ PORTABILITY: Configured with warnings
  ELSE:
    ❌ PORTABILITY: Configuration errors detected
ELSE:
  ❌ PORTABILITY: Incomplete configuration
```

**Recommendations Generated:**
- Missing fields: Create/update in kds.config.json
- Invalid paths: Correct absolute paths
- Command issues: Install dependencies or update PATH
- Test config: Create config files or update paths

### 1. Build Validation
```powershell
# Run build
dotnet build SPA/NoorCanvas/NoorCanvas.csproj

# Check result
IF $LASTEXITCODE -eq 0:
  ✅ Build successful
ELSE:
  ❌ Build failed
  
# Check warnings
Parse build output for warnings
IF warnings > 0:
  ⚠️ Build succeeded with warnings
```

### 2. Test Validation
```powershell
# Run all tests
dotnet test --no-build

# Parse results
Total: X
Passed: Y
Failed: Z
Skipped: W

# Determine status
IF Failed == 0:
  IF Skipped == 0:
    ✅ All tests passed
  ELSE:
    ⚠️ Tests passed but some skipped
ELSE:
  ❌ Tests failed
```

### 3. Code Quality Validation
```powershell
# Run Roslynator analysis (if available)
dotnet roslynator analyze SPA/NoorCanvas/NoorCanvas.csproj

# Parse results
Errors: X
Warnings: Y
Info: Z

# Determine status
IF Errors > 0:
  ❌ Quality check failed
ELSE IF Warnings > 0:
  ⚠️ Quality warnings found
ELSE:
  ✅ Code quality excellent
```

### 4. Git Status Validation
```powershell
# Check working directory
git status --porcelain

# Parse output
Untracked: X files
Modified: Y files
Staged: Z files

# Check branch status
git fetch origin
git status

# Determine status
IF untracked + modified + staged == 0:
  ✅ Clean working directory
ELSE:
  ⚠️ Uncommitted changes
  
IF behind origin:
  ⚠️ Branch behind origin
```

  2. Retry with: dotnet test (includes build)
  3. Report failure in health report
```

### Quality Tool Missing
```markdown
⚠️ Roslynator not installed

Action:
