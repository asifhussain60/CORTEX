# CORTEX Universal Entry Point (Migration)

This file exists only to ease the switch from the legacy KDS entry point.

Use this as the single command going forward:

#file:CORTEX/cortex.md

Notes:
- The old KDS entry point `#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md` is deprecated.
- CORTEX keeps prompts lean. Long content lives in docs and agents; the entry file remains small by design.
- If you land here from an old script, update it to point to `CORTEX/cortex.md`.
