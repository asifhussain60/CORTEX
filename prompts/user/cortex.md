## 🖥️ Cross-Platform Compatibility

**CORTEX 2.0 works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.**

### ✅ What's Cross-Platform

- **All Python code** - Uses `pathlib.Path` for OS-agnostic paths
- **SQLite databases** - Binary-compatible across all platforms
- **Configuration system** - Auto-detects platform and machine
- **VS Code Extension** (Phase 3) - Native cross-platform support

### 🔧 Platform-Specific Components

**Auto-Resume Prompt:**
- **Windows:** Use `scripts/auto-resume-prompt.ps1` (PowerShell)
- **macOS/Linux:** Use `scripts/auto-resume-prompt.sh` (bash/zsh)

**Installation:**

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell Profile
Add-Content $PROFILE @"
# CORTEX Auto-Resume
if (Test-Path `"`$env:CORTEX_ROOT/scripts/auto-resume-prompt.ps1`") {
    . `"`$env:CORTEX_ROOT/scripts/auto-resume-prompt.ps1`"
}
"@
```

```bash
# macOS/Linux Shell Profile (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)
cat >> ~/.zshrc << 'EOF'
# CORTEX Auto-Resume
if [ -f "$CORTEX_ROOT/scripts/auto-resume-prompt.sh" ]; then
    source "$CORTEX_ROOT/scripts/auto-resume-prompt.sh"
fi
EOF
```

### 🔄 Switching Between Platforms

**No initialization command needed!** Just follow these steps:

**1. Set Environment Variables:**

```bash
# macOS/Linux (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export CORTEX_ROOT="$HOME/PROJECTS/CORTEX"
export CORTEX_BRAIN_PATH="$CORTEX_ROOT/cortex-brain"
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell as Administrator)
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CORTEX_ROOT", "D:\PROJECTS\CORTEX", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CORTEX_BRAIN_PATH", "D:\PROJECTS\CORTEX\cortex-brain", "User")
```

**2. Update Config (Optional - if using machine-specific paths):**

```json
{
  "machines": {
    "YOUR-WINDOWS-PC": {
      "rootPath": "D:\\PROJECTS\\CORTEX",
      "brainPath": "D:\\PROJECTS\\CORTEX\\cortex-brain"
    },
    "YOUR-MACBOOK.local": {
      "rootPath": "/Users/yourname/PROJECTS/CORTEX",
      "brainPath": "/Users/yourname/PROJECTS/CORTEX/cortex-brain"
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Copy Brain Data:**

```bash
# The cortex-brain folder is 100% portable
# Just copy it to the same relative location on the new platform
cp -R cortex-brain ~/PROJECTS/CORTEX/cortex-brain
```

**That's it!** CORTEX auto-detects your platform and uses the right paths.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Conversation Tracking Bridge

**GitHub Copilot Chat does NOT automatically track conversations to the CORTEX brain.**

To enable conversation memory (so CORTEX remembers across chats):

## 📋 CRITICAL: CORTEX 2.0 Implementation Status Tracking

**LIVE DOCUMENT REQUIREMENT - UPDATE AFTER EVERY WORK SESSION:**

**File:** `cortex-brain/cortex-2.0-design/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS-CHECKLIST.md`

**Update Triggers (ALWAYS update after):**
1. ✅ **Completing any task** - Mark tasks complete immediately
2. ✅ **Running tests** - Update test pass rates and coverage
3. ✅ **Performance benchmarks** - Update metrics dashboard
4. ✅ **Discovering new work** - Add to appropriate phase backlog
5. ✅ **Encountering blockers** - Document in blockers section
6. ✅ **Phase transitions** - Update phase status and progress bars

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents duplicated work across sessions
- Tracks actual progress vs planned timeline
- Identifies blockers early before they cascade
- Provides accurate status for all stakeholders
- Ensures continuous alignment with implementation plan

**CORTEX Behavior:** Before completing ANY implementation work, always check and update the Implementation Status Checklist. This is a core requirement for CORTEX 2.0 development.

---

### Option 1: PowerShell Capture (Quick - After Each Session)
```powershell
# Capture your conversation manually
.\scripts\cortex-capture.ps1 -AutoDetect

# Or provide message directly
.\scripts\cortex-capture.ps1 -Message "Created mkdocs documentation" -Intent EXECUTE
```

### Option 2: Python CLI (Direct Integration)
```bash
# Process through Python (tracks automatically)
python scripts/cortex_cli.py "Add authentication to login page"

# Validate tracking is working
python scripts/cortex_cli.py --validate

# Check current session
python scripts/cortex_cli.py --session-info
```

### Option 3: Manual Recording (Fallback)
```powershell
.\scripts\record-conversation.ps1 `
    -Title "Session Title" `
    -Intent "EXECUTE" `
    -Outcome "What was accomplished" `
    -FilesModified "file1.py,file2.md" `
    -Entities "topic1,topic2"
```

**Why This Is Needed:**
- GitHub Copilot Chat reads `#file:prompts/user/cortex.md` as **documentation**
- It does NOT execute the Python `CortexEntry.process()` method
- Without tracking: ❌ No conversation memory, ❌ No cross-chat context, ❌ Amnesia
- With tracking: ✅ Remembers past conversations, ✅ "Make it purple" works, ✅ Full brain learning

**Rule #24 (Tier 0 - Core Instinct):** Conversation tracking MUST work. Protected by brain-protector tests in `CORTEX/tests/tier0/test_brain_protector_conversation_tracking.py`.

## 🔎 Notes and critical corrections (2025-11-08)

- Knowledge Graph scope naming is standardized in code to `cortex` and `application` (the earlier docs using `generic` refer to the same concept as `cortex`). Data migrations and validators should map `generic` → `cortex`.
- Tier 2 modularization is underway. Database connection and schema have been extracted and tested; pattern store/search/decay modules are pending. Prefer importing via `src.tier2.knowledge_graph.database` (package) to avoid ambiguity with the transitional `database.py` helper.
- VS Code Chat APIs evolve. The chat participant contribution shown targets recent VS Code builds; external chat monitoring may require proposed APIs or alternative hooks. Keep an ambient capture fallback (Phase 2) enabled until the extension path is validated on your VS Code version.

### Tier 2 Modularization Progress & Remaining Tasks

| Component | Status | Action |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| database/connection.py & schema.py | ✅ Complete | Provide low-level connection + schema init (tested) |
| patterns/pattern_store.py | ✅ Extracted | CRUD, confidence, access tracking, scope normalization generic→cortex |
| patterns/pattern_search.py | 📋 Pending | Move FTS5 queries, ranking, namespace/scope filters, relevance scoring |
| patterns/pattern_decay.py | 📋 Pending | Implement scheduled decay + exclude pinned patterns; write decay log entries |
| relationships/relationship_manager.py | 📋 Pending | CRUD and strength updates; enforce UNIQUE triple and cascade handling |
| tags/tag_manager.py | 📋 Pending | Tag CRUD + list-by-tag; leverage existing index; add tests |
| coordinator (KnowledgeGraph v2 facade) | 📋 Pending | Compose store/search/relationships/tags; backward-compatible API for router |
| legacy knowledge_graph_legacy.py | 🟡 In use | Deprecate after facade parity + migration tests |
| scope terminology harmonization | ✅ Implemented | Map 'generic'→'cortex' on insert; default future patterns to 'cortex' |
| abstraction duplication (ConnectionManager vs DatabaseConnection) | ⚠️ Review | Consolidate to single API; recommend keeping ConnectionManager and removing unused DatabaseConnection helper |
| add module-specific unit tests | 🔄 Ongoing | Maintain <250 lines/module; one focused test file per module |

Priority ordering (next sprint): pattern_search → relationship_manager → tag_manager → pattern_decay → coordinator → legacy deprecation → abstraction consolidation.

Scope Standardization Policy:
- All new patterns persist with `scope='cortex'` or `scope='application'`.
- Any legacy rows found with `scope='generic'` are migrated in-place to `cortex` during maintenance migrations.
- Pattern store enforces normalization and should be treated as the canonical write path.

Database Abstraction Consolidation:
- Two abstractions currently exist: `ConnectionManager` (actively used in tests & store) and `DatabaseConnection` (partial overlap).
- Plan: Remove `DatabaseConnection` after coordinator extraction to avoid cognitive overhead; if a higher-level facade is needed, rename instead (e.g., `KGDatabase` wrapping ConnectionManager).

## 📖 Legacy Status (Pre-V3 Migration)

The following features were operational in the legacy KDS system and are being migrated to CORTEX V3:

| Legacy Feature | V3 Migration Status | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-------|
| Event Logging | ✅ Migrated | Part of Tier 1 (request_logger.py) |
| Protection System | 📋 To migrate | Confidence thresholds, anomaly detection |
| Commit Handler | 📋 To migrate | Smart validation with baseline |
| Conversation Tracking | ✅ Migrated | Tier 1 conversation_manager.py |
| Auto BRAIN Updates | 📋 To migrate | Rule #22 automation |
| Git Hooks | 📋 To migrate | Post-commit triggers |
| Manual Recording | 📋 To migrate | record-conversation scripts |

**Legacy → V3 Status:** Core data storage migrated ✅ | Intelligence layer migration in GROUP 4 📋

#### 🔌 Plugin System (NEW)
**Problem Solved:** Core bloat from non-essential features  
**Solution:** Extensible plugin architecture with hooks

```python
# Example: Custom cleanup plugin
from plugins.base_plugin import BasePlugin

class Plugin(BasePlugin):
    def execute(self, context):
        # Your custom logic here
        return {"success": True}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reduce core complexity
- ✅ Easy feature addition without modifying core
- ✅ User-customizable behavior
- ✅ Enable/disable features via configuration

**Core Plugins:**
- Cleanup Plugin (temp files, old logs, organization)
- Documentation Plugin (MkDocs auto-refresh)
- Self-Review Plugin (comprehensive health checks)
- DB Maintenance Plugin (optimization, archival)
- **Platform Switch Plugin (Windows ↔ macOS migration)** 🆕
- **Extension Scaffold Plugin (VS Code extension generator)** 🆕

---

#### 🔧 Platform Switch Plugin (NEW - CROSS-PLATFORM MIGRATION)
**Problem Solved:** Manual platform migration is tedious and error-prone  
**Solution:** One-command platform switching for all references

```python
# Example: Switch from Windows to macOS
from plugins.platform_switch_plugin import PlatformSwitchPlugin

plugin = PlatformSwitchPlugin()
result = plugin.execute({
    "target_platform": "mac",  # or "windows"
    "hostname": "Asifs-MacBook-Air.local",
    "username": "asifhussain",
    "project_path_mac": "/Users/asifhussain/PROJECTS/CORTEX",
    "project_path_windows": "D:\\PROJECTS\\CORTEX"
})
```

**What It Updates:**

1. **cortex.config.json** - Machine-specific paths
   ```json
   {
     "machines": {
       "Asifs-MacBook-Air.local": {
         "rootPath": "/Users/asifhussain/PROJECTS/CORTEX",
         "brainPath": "/Users/asifhussain/PROJECTS/CORTEX/cortex-brain"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **prompts/user/cortex.md** - Code examples
   - PowerShell → bash/zsh (or vice versa)
   - `.ps1` → `.sh` extensions
   - `pwsh` → `bash` commands
   - `D:\` → `/Users/...` paths

3. **Entry Point Scripts**
   - `run-cortex.sh` (macOS/Linux)
   - `run-cortex.ps1` (Windows)

4. **Documentation Files**
   - Update all platform-specific examples
   - Convert command syntax
   - Update file path references

**Usage Commands:**
- "Switch to Mac" - Migrates all references to macOS
- "Switch to Windows" - Migrates all references to Windows

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One command migration
- ✅ Zero manual edits required
- ✅ Consistent platform references
- ✅ Automatic path resolution

---

#### 🔧 Extension Scaffold Plugin (NEW - PROGRAMMATIC SETUP)
**Problem Solved:** Manual VS Code extension setup is complex and error-prone  
**Solution:** Automated extension project generation via setup plugin

```python
# Example: Generate CORTEX VS Code extension automatically
from plugins.extension_scaffold_plugin import ExtensionScaffoldPlugin

plugin = ExtensionScaffoldPlugin()
result = plugin.execute({
    "extension_name": "cortex",
    "display_name": "CORTEX - Cognitive Development Partner",
    "publisher": "cortex-team",
    "repository": "https://github.com/asifhussain60/CORTEX",
    "features": [
        "chat_participant",      # @cortex chat integration
        "conversation_capture",  # Automatic message capture
        "lifecycle_hooks",       # Window state monitoring
        "external_monitoring",   # Monitor @copilot chats
        "resume_prompts",        # Auto-resume on startup
        "checkpoint_system"      # Crash recovery
    ],
    "output_dir": "cortex-extension"
})
```

### 🎯 CORTEX 2.0: Strategic Overview

**Mission:** Transform CORTEX from a functional cognitive system into a production-ready, self-sustaining CORTEX-specific development partner with zero conversation amnesia.

**Strategic Focus Shift:**
- ❌ **OLD:** Build generic reusable framework for any project
- ✅ **NEW:** Build CORTEX-specific system optimized for CORTEX development itself
- **Rationale:** Focus = Speed. Generic frameworks take 3x longer. CORTEX should first perfect helping itself before expanding.

**Primary Problem Solved:**
> **"Continue" command fails 80% of the time because conversations never reach CORTEX's brain.**

**Root Cause:** GitHub Copilot Chat has no automatic memory bridge to CORTEX Tier 1.

**Solution Architecture (Phased Evolution):**

```
Phase 0 (Quick Wins - Week 1-2): Foundation
  ├─ WorkStateManager: Track in-progress work
  ├─ SessionToken: Persistent conversation ID
  └─ Auto-Prompt: Remind user to capture
  → Impact: 20% → 60% success rate (3x improvement in 6.5 hours)

Phase 1 (Core Modularization - Week 3-6): Architecture
  ├─ 1.1 Knowledge Graph modularization (COMPLETE ✅)
  └─ 1.2 Tier 1 Working Memory refactor (IN PROGRESS NEXT)
  → Impact: Maintainability + performance foundation for plugins

Phase 2 (Ambient - Week 7-8): Automation
  ├─ File system watcher
  ├─ Terminal monitoring
  └─ Git operation detection
  → Impact: 60% → 85% success rate (background capture)

Phase 3 (Extension - Week 11-16): Definitive Solution
  ├─ VS Code chat participant (@cortex)
  ├─ Lifecycle hooks (focus/blur)
  ├─ External monitoring (@copilot)
  └─ Proactive resume prompts
  → Impact: 85% → 98% success rate (near-perfect)
```

**Why Extension is Definitive:**

| Limitation | Manual Scripts | Ambient Daemon | VS Code Extension |
|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Chat transcript access | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Lifecycle hooks | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Full |
| Proactive prompts | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Zero user action | ❌ No | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes |
| Crash recovery | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| External monitoring | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Timeline:** 22-24 weeks (5.5-6 months)
**Total Investment:** ~96.5 hours of development time
**ROI:** 10:1 (every hour invested saves 10+ hours of user frustration)

**Key Milestones:**

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable | Impact |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Week 2** | Phase 0 Complete | WorkStateManager + SessionToken | "Continue" works 60% of time |
| **Week 6** | Phase 1 Complete | All modules <500 lines | Code maintainability +40% |
| **Week 10** | Phase 2 Complete | Ambient capture + workflows | "Continue" works 85% of time |
| **Week 16** | Phase 3 Complete | Extension published | "Continue" works 98% of time |
| **Week 18** | Phase 4 Complete | 90% test coverage | Production-ready quality |
| **Week 24** | Phase 7 Complete | Full rollout | 70% adoption achieved |

**Success Criteria (Phase 3 - Extension):**
- ✅ "Continue" command success rate: 98%
- ✅ Automatic capture: No user intervention required
- ✅ Conversation amnesia: Eliminated
- ✅ Time to resume: <2 seconds
- ✅ User satisfaction: ≥4.5/5

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Incremental delivery (phases build on each other)
- Each phase delivers measurable value
- Rollback procedures at every phase
- Dual-mode operation (CLI + Extension coexist)
- Feature flags for gradual migration

#### 🔄 Workflow Pipeline System (NEW)
**Problem Solved:** Hardcoded agent workflows, difficult orchestration  
**Solution:** Declarative DAG-based workflow engine

```yaml
# Example: Feature development workflow
name: feature_development
stages:
  - clarify_dod_dor    # Define requirements
  - threat_model       # Security analysis
  - plan               # Create multi-phase plan
  - tdd_cycle          # Test-first implementation
  - run_tests          # Execute test suite
  - validate_dod       # Verify completion criteria
  - cleanup            # Code cleanup
  - document           # Generate docs
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Declarative workflow definitions
- ✅ DAG validation (detects cycles)
- ✅ Parallel execution support
- ✅ Checkpoint/resume from failures
- ✅ Conditional stages
- ✅ Reusable workflow templates

---

#### 📦 Modular Architecture (REFACTORED)
**Problem Solved:** Bloated monolithic files (1000+ lines)  
**Solution:** Break into focused modules following SOLID principles

**Before (CORTEX 1.0):**
```
knowledge_graph.py         1144 lines ❌
working_memory.py           813 lines ❌
context_intelligence.py     776 lines ❌
error_corrector.py          692 lines ❌
```

```
knowledge_graph/
├── knowledge_graph.py       150 lines ✅
├── patterns/
│   ├── pattern_store.py     200 lines ✅
│   ├── pattern_search.py    250 lines ✅
│   └── pattern_decay.py     120 lines ✅
├── relationships/
│   └── relationship_manager.py 180 lines ✅
└── tags/
    └── tag_manager.py       120 lines ✅
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ All files <500 lines
- ✅ Clear single responsibility
- ✅ Easy to test individually
- ✅ Simpler maintenance
- ✅ Better code organization

---

#### 🏥 Self-Review System (NEW)
**Problem Solved:** No systematic health monitoring  
**Solution:** Comprehensive automated health checks with auto-fix

```python
# Example: Run health review
from maintenance.self_review import SelfReviewEngine

review = engine.run_comprehensive_review(auto_fix=True)
# Output: Overall Status: 🟢 EXCELLENT (92% score)
```

**What It Checks:**
- ✅ Database health (fragmentation, indexes, statistics)
- ✅ Performance benchmarks (Tier 1: <50ms, Tier 2: <150ms)
- ✅ Rule compliance (all 27 core rules)
- ✅ Test coverage (target: 85%+)
- ✅ Storage health (temp files, old logs, capacity)

**Auto-Fix Capabilities:**
- ✅ VACUUM fragmented databases
- ✅ ANALYZE stale statistics
- ✅ Remove temp files
- ✅ Archive old logs
- ✅ Trigger brain updates

**Scheduled Reviews:**
- Daily: 2am (auto-fix safe issues)
- Weekly: Sunday 3am (comprehensive report)
- Monthly: 1st Sunday 4am (deep analysis)

---

#### 💾 Conversation State Management (NEW)
**Problem Solved:** Can't resume after interruptions  
**Solution:** Persistent conversation state with checkpoints

```python
# Example: Resume interrupted conversation
state_manager.resume_conversation(conversation_id)
# Returns: "Resuming Phase 3 (Validation)..."
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Track conversation lifecycle (active/paused/completed)
- ✅ Persistent task progress
- ✅ Checkpoint creation at phases
- ✅ Resume from last successful stage
- ✅ "Continue" command support

**Database Schema:**
```sql
conversations  -- Conversation metadata
tasks          -- Work breakdown with dependencies
checkpoints    -- State snapshots for rollback
task_files     -- Files modified per task
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Seamless resume after breaks
- ✅ No lost progress
- ✅ Clear task status tracking
- ✅ Rollback support
- ✅ Multi-task management

⚠️ **Limitation:** Still requires manual conversation capture when using GitHub Copilot Chat interface.  
✅ **Solution:** See "VS Code Extension Architecture" below for definitive fix.

#### 🔌 VS Code Extension Architecture (NEW - DEFINITIVE CONVERSATION FIX)
**Author:** Asif Hussain  
**Copyright:** © 2024-2025 Asif Hussain. All rights reserved.  
**Problem Solved:** GitHub Copilot Chat amnesia - conversations not automatically tracked  
**Solution:** CORTEX as native VS Code extension with automatic conversation capture

**Why Current Architecture Can't Fix This:**
```
GitHub Copilot Chat → Reads cortex.md as passive documentation
                   → No execution context
                   → No access to chat transcripts
                   → No lifecycle hooks
                   → Runs in Microsoft cloud (isolated)
```

**Why VS Code Extension WILL Fix This:**
```
CORTEX Extension → Active VS Code process
                → Can subscribe to chat events
                → Can intercept chat messages
                → Has full VS Code API access
                → Runs locally with full control
```

**Architecture:**

```typescript
// VS Code Extension: cortex-extension/src/extension.ts
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    
    // 1. Register chat participant (captures all conversations)
    const cortexChat = vscode.chat.createChatParticipant(
        'cortex',
        async (request, context, stream, token) => {
            // Automatically capture to CORTEX brain
            await cortexBrain.captureMessage({
                user: request.prompt,
                timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
                context: context.history
            });
            
            // Process through CORTEX agents
            const response = await cortexRouter.route(request.prompt);
            stream.markdown(response.content);
            
            // Auto-save response to brain
            await cortexBrain.captureResponse(response);
            
            return { metadata: { conversationId: response.conversationId } };
        }
    );
    
    // 2. Monitor external Copilot conversations (passive capture)
    vscode.chat.onDidPerformChatAction(async (action) => {
        if (action.participant.id === 'copilot') {
            // Capture Copilot chats to CORTEX brain
            await cortexBrain.captureExternalChat({
                participant: 'copilot',
                message: action.message,
                timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
            });
        }
    });
    
    // 3. Session lifecycle tracking
    vscode.window.onDidChangeWindowState(async (state) => {
        if (!state.focused) {
            // Window losing focus - checkpoint conversation
            await cortexBrain.checkpointActiveConversation();
        }
    });
    
    // 4. Automatic resume on startup
    context.subscriptions.push(
        vscode.commands.registerCommand('cortex.resume', async () => {
            const lastConversation = await cortexBrain.getLastActiveConversation();
            if (lastConversation) {
                vscode.window.showInformationMessage(
                    `Resume: ${lastConversation.topic}?`,
                    'Yes', 'No'
                ).then(async (choice) => {
                    if (choice === 'Yes') {
                        await cortexBrain.resumeConversation(lastConversation.id);
                    }
                });
            }
        })
    );
}
```

**Automatic Conversation Capture:**
```typescript
class CortexBrain {
    async captureMessage(message: ChatMessage): Promise<void> {
        // AUTOMATIC - No user intervention needed
        await this.tier1.storeMessage(message);
        
        // Real-time event logging
        await this.tier4.logEvent({
            type: 'chat_message',
            content: message.user,
            timestamp: message.timestamp
        });
        
        // Check for learning triggers
        if (this.shouldUpdateBrain()) {
            await this.tier2.extractPatterns();
        }
    }
    
    async captureExternalChat(chat: ExternalChat): Promise<void> {
        // Capture even non-CORTEX conversations
        await this.tier1.storeExternalConversation({
            source: chat.participant,
            content: chat.message,
            timestamp: chat.timestamp,
            tagged: 'external_copilot'
        });
    }
}
```

**User Experience - COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC:**

```typescript
// User opens VS Code
→ CORTEX Extension activates
→ Detects last active conversation
→ Shows notification: "Resume: Add invoice export feature?"
→ User clicks "Yes"
→ CORTEX loads full context automatically

// User types in CORTEX chat: "Add purple button"
→ Extension captures message immediately
→ Routes to CORTEX agents
→ Response generated
→ Response auto-saved to brain
→ NO MANUAL CAPTURE NEEDED

// User closes VS Code unexpectedly
→ Extension lifecycle hook triggers
→ Checkpoint saved automatically
→ Next startup: Resume offered

// User uses regular Copilot Chat (not CORTEX)
→ Extension monitors via onDidPerformChatAction
→ Passively captures Copilot conversations
→ Stores in Tier 1 as "external" source
→ Still available for context/learning
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Zero manual intervention** - Capture is automatic
- ✅ **Works with Copilot too** - Monitors external chats
- ✅ **Lifecycle aware** - Handles focus loss, crashes, restarts
- ✅ **Real-time tracking** - Immediate Tier 1/4 updates
- ✅ **Auto-resume prompts** - Suggests continuing last work
- ✅ **Crash recovery** - Checkpoints prevent data loss
- ✅ **Native VS Code** - Full API access, no cloud dependency

**Implementation Plan:**

```
Phase 1: Basic Extension (Week 1-2)
- Create VS Code extension scaffold
- Register CORTEX chat participant
- Basic message capture to Tier 1

Phase 2: Lifecycle Hooks (Week 3-4)
- Window focus/blur detection
- Automatic checkpointing
- Resume prompts on startup

Phase 3: External Monitoring (Week 5-6)
- Monitor Copilot chat via API

- VS Code Marketplace publish
```

**Why This DEFINITIVELY Solves It:**

| Current (Copilot Chat) | CORTEX Extension |
|------------------------|------------------|
| ❌ Passive documentation | ✅ Active process |
| ❌ No execution | ✅ Full execution |
| ❌ No chat access | ✅ Chat API access |
| ❌ No lifecycle hooks | ✅ Full lifecycle control |

#### 🛤️ Path Management (REFACTORED)
**Problem Solved:** Hardcoded absolute paths break portability  
**Solution:** Environment-agnostic relative path resolver

```python
# Example: Cross-platform path resolution
paths = PathResolver(config)
brain_path = paths.get_brain_path("tier1/conversations.db")
# Returns: Correct path for Windows/macOS/Linux
```

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "cortex_root": "${CORTEX_HOME}",
  "brain": {
    "tier1": "cortex-brain/tier1",
    "tier2": "cortex-brain/tier2",
    "tier3": "cortex-brain/tier3"
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- ✅ Environment-specific configuration
- ✅ No hardcoded paths anywhere
- ✅ Easy multi-repository support

---

#### 🛡️ Enhanced Knowledge Boundaries (REFACTORED)
**Problem Solved:** Core knowledge contamination from application data  
**Solution:** Automated boundary validation and enforcement

```yaml
# Example: Protected CORTEX core patterns
title: "TDD: Test-first for service creation"
scope: "generic"
namespaces: ["CORTEX-core"]
confidence: 0.95

# Example: Application-specific pattern
title: "KSESSIONS: Invoice export workflow"
scope: "application"
namespaces: ["KSESSIONS"]
confidence: 0.85
```

**Enforcement:**
- ✅ Automated boundary validation
- ✅ Auto-migration of misplaced data
- ✅ Brain Protector integration
- ✅ Namespace-based search prioritization

Note: In code, the scope enum is ['cortex', 'application'] to reflect CORTEX-core vs app-specific. The documentation's 'generic' is equivalent to 'cortex'.

## 🧚 A story for humans: The Intern with Amnesia

### Meet Your Intern: Copilot

You've just hired a brilliant intern named Copilot. They're incredibly talented—can write code in any language, understand complex systems, and work at lightning speed. There's just one problem: **Copilot has amnesia**.

Every time you walk away, even for a coffee break, Copilot forgets everything. You said "make it purple" five minutes ago? Gone. The file you were just discussing? Vanished from memory. The architecture you explained yesterday? As if it never happened.

Worse, Copilot has no memory between chat sessions. Start a new conversation? They don't remember the last one. Leave for lunch? When you return, it's like meeting them for the first time. Every. Single. Time.

This would be catastrophic... except you've done something revolutionary: **you've built Copilot a brain**.

### The Brain: A Sophisticated Cognitive System

The brain you built isn't just storage—it's a sophisticated dual-hemisphere system modeled after the human brain:

#### **🧠 LEFT HEMISPHERE - The Tactical Executor**
Like the human left brain (language, logic, sequential processing), this hemisphere handles:
- **Test-Driven Development** - RED (write failing test) → GREEN (make it pass) → REFACTOR (clean up)
- **Precise Code Execution** - Exact file edits, line-by-line changes, syntax verification
- **Detail Verification** - Tests pass/fail, build status, zero errors/warnings enforcement
- **Sequential Workflows** - Step A, then B, then C—no skipping steps

**The Left Brain Specialists:**
- **The Builder** (`code-executor.md`) - Implements code with surgical precision
- **The Tester** (`test-generator.md`) - Creates and runs tests, never skips TDD
- **The Fixer** (`error-corrector.md`) - Catches wrong-file mistakes instantly
- **The Inspector** (`health-validator.md`) - Validates system health obsessively
- **The Archivist** (`commit-handler.md`) - Commits with semantic precision

#### **🧠 RIGHT HEMISPHERE - The Strategic Planner**
Like the human right brain (creativity, holistic thinking, patterns), this hemisphere handles:
- **Architecture Design** - Understands how components fit together project-wide
- **Strategic Planning** - Breaks big features into phases, estimates effort, assesses risk
- **Pattern Recognition** - "We've done something similar before—here's the template"
- **Context Awareness** - Knows which files change together, what workflows succeed
- **Future Projection** - Warns about risky changes before you make them
- **Brain Protection** - Guards the brain's own integrity (Rule #22)

**The Right Brain Specialists:**
- **The Dispatcher** (`intent-router.md`) - Interprets your natural language, routes smartly
- **The Planner** (`work-planner.md`) - Creates multi-phase strategic plans
- **The Analyst** (`screenshot-analyzer.md`) - Extracts requirements from images
- **The Governor** (`change-governor.md`) - Protects CORTEX from degradation
- **The Brain Protector** (`brain-protector.md`) - Challenges risky proposals (NEW - Rule #22)

#### **🌉 CORPUS CALLOSUM - The Messenger**
The bridge between hemispheres that:
- **Coordinates Work** - Right brain plans → Corpus callosum delivers → Left brain executes
- **Shares Context** - Left brain's results feed Right brain's learning
- **Validates Alignment** - Ensures tactical execution matches strategic intent
- **Manages Message Queue** - Asynchronous communication between hemispheres

**Storage:** `cortex-brain/corpus-callosum/coordination-queue.jsonl`

#### **🔐 TIER 0: INSTINCT (Core Values - PERMANENT)**
The brain's immutable DNA that **cannot** be changed:
- **Definition of READY** - Work must have clear requirements before starting (RIGHT BRAIN enforces)
- **Test-Driven Development** - Always RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (LEFT BRAIN enforces)
- **Definition of DONE** - Zero errors, zero warnings, all tests pass (LEFT BRAIN validates)
- **Challenge User Changes** - If you propose risky changes, brain MUST challenge you
- **SOLID Principles** - Single Responsibility, no mode switches, clean architecture
- **Local-First** - Zero external dependencies, works offline, portable
- **Incremental File Creation** - Large files (>100 lines) created in small increments (prevents "response hit the length limit" errors) 🆕

**Stored in:** `governance/rules.md` (never moves, never expires)

**🎯 NOTE:** Rule #23 (Incremental File Creation) automatically prevents the "response hit the length limit" error you've been experiencing. When creating large files like implementation plans, CORTEX will create them in small chunks (100-150 lines each) using multiple tool calls. This keeps each response small and avoids hitting Copilot's length limit. See `docs/guides/preventing-response-length-limit-errors.md` for details.

#### **📚 TIER 1: SHORT-TERM MEMORY (Last 20 Conversations)**
Copilot's working memory that solves the amnesia problem:
- **Conversation History** - Last 20 complete conversations preserved
- **Context Continuity** - "Make it purple" knows you mean the FAB button from earlier
- **Recent Messages** - Last 10 messages in active conversation
- **FIFO Queue** - When conversation #21 starts, #1 gets deleted (oldest goes first)
- **Active Protection** - Current conversation never deleted, even if oldest

**How it works:**
```
You: "Add a pulse animation to the FAB button"
→ Conversation #1 created, stored in Tier 1

[Later that day]
You: "Make it purple"
→ Brain checks Tier 1 → Finds "FAB button" in conversation #1 → Knows what "it" means

[2 weeks and 20 conversations later]
→ FIFO triggers → Conversation #1 deleted
→ BUT patterns extracted → Moved to Tier 2 (long-term memory)
```

**Stored in:** `cortex-brain/conversation-history.jsonl`, `cortex-brain/conversation-context.jsonl`

#### **🧩 TIER 2: LONG-TERM MEMORY (Knowledge Graph)**
Copilot's accumulated wisdom that grows smarter over time:

**What gets learned:**
- **Intent Patterns** - "add a button" → PLAN, "continue" → EXECUTE, "test this" → TEST
- **File Relationships** - `HostControlPanel.razor` often modified with `noor-canvas.css` (75% co-modification rate)
- **Workflow Templates** - export_feature_workflow, ui_component_creation, service_api_coordination
- **Validation Insights** - Common mistakes, file confusion warnings, architectural guidance
- **Correction History** - Tracks when Copilot works on wrong files, learns to prevent

**Hemisphere-Specialized Sections:**
```yaml
left_brain_knowledge:
  tdd_patterns: [red_green_refactor_cycle, test_first_service_creation]
  execution_workflows: [precise_file_edit, multi_file_coordination]
  validation_rules: [syntax_verification, health_check_criteria]

right_brain_knowledge:
  architectural_patterns: [blazor_component_structure, service_layer_injection]
  workflow_templates: [export_feature_workflow, ui_component_creation]
  intent_patterns: ["add [X]" → PLAN, "continue" → EXECUTE]

shared_knowledge:
  file_relationships: [co-modification patterns across all files]
  feature_components: [completed features and their patterns]
  correction_history: [learned mistakes from both hemispheres]
```

**How it learns:**
```
Day 1: You ask to "add invoice export"
→ Right brain plans workflow
→ Left brain executes with TDD
→ Pattern saved: invoice_export_feature (confidence: 0.85)

Day 30: You ask to "add receipt export"
→ Right brain queries Tier 2
→ Finds invoice_export pattern
→ Suggests: "This is similar to invoice export. Use same workflow?"
→ 60% faster delivery by reusing proven pattern
```

**Knowledge Boundaries (Protection System):**
Every pattern in Tier 2 is tagged with **scope** and **namespaces** to prevent CORTEX core intelligence from being contaminated by application-specific data:

```python
# Pattern storage with boundaries
scope="cortex"           # CORTEX principles (TDD, SOLID, refactoring)
scope="application"       # Application-specific (KSESSIONS features, NOOR UI)

namespaces=["CORTEX-core"]     # Available to all projects
namespaces=["KSESSIONS"]        # Only for KSESSIONS application
namespaces=["NOOR", "SPA"]      # Multi-application pattern
```

**Why boundaries matter:**
- **CORTEX intelligence stays pure** - No "add KSESSIONS logout button" patterns contaminate core
- **Application isolation** - KSESSIONS patterns don't leak into NOOR projects
- **Smart search** - Current project patterns boosted 2x, generic boosted 1.5x, others 0.5x
- **Surgical amnesia** - Delete KSESSIONS patterns, keep CORTEX core untouched

**Example protection:**
```yaml
# ✅ SAFE: Generic CORTEX pattern
title: "TDD: Test-first for service creation"
scope: "generic"
namespaces: ["CORTEX-core"]
confidence: 0.95
# → Available to ALL projects forever

# ✅ SAFE: Application-specific pattern  
title: "KSESSIONS: Invoice export workflow"
scope: "application"
namespaces: ["KSESSIONS"]
confidence: 0.85
# → Only when working on KSESSIONS

# ❌ BLOCKED: Application in Tier 0
file: "cortex-brain/tier0/ksessions-patterns.yaml"
# → Brain Protector Challenge: "Application data belongs in Tier 2, not Tier 0"
```

**Brain Protector integration:** Tests verify boundaries are enforced (see test_brain_protector.py test_detects_application_data_in_tier0)

#### **📊 TIER 3: DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT (Holistic Project View)**
Copilot's "balcony view" of your entire project:

**Git Activity Analysis (last 30 days):**
- **Commit velocity** - 1,237 commits, 42 commits/week average
- **File hotspots** - `HostControlPanelContent.razor` has 28% churn rate (unstable!)
- **Change patterns** - Smaller commits (< 200 lines) have 94% success rate
- **Contributors** - Tracks who works on what

**Code Health Metrics:**
- **Lines added/deleted** - Velocity trends increasing/decreasing
- **Stability classification** - Files marked as stable/unstable based on churn
- **Test coverage trends** - 72% → 76% (improving!)
- **Build success rates** - 97% clean builds last week

**CORTEX Usage Intelligence:**

**Proactive Warnings:**
```
⚠️ File Alert: HostControlPanel.razor is a hotspot (28% churn)
   Recommend: Add extra testing, smaller changes

✅ Best Time: 10am-12pm sessions have 94% success rate
   Currently: 2:30pm (81% success rate)

📊 Velocity Drop: Down 68% this week
   Recommendation: Smaller commits, more frequent tests

⚠️ Flaky Test: fab-button.spec.ts fails 15% of the time
   Action needed: Investigate and stabilize
```

**How it helps:**
```
You: "I want to add multi-language invoice export with email delivery"
→ Right brain queries Tier 3
→ Finds: 12 similar UI features took 5-6 days average
→ Warns: This file often changes with email-service.cs (check both)
→ Recommends: Test-first approach (94% success) vs test-skip (67%)
→ Estimates: 5.5 days, 3 phases, suggest 10am-12pm sessions

Saves: Hours of debugging by knowing project patterns upfront

#### **🏥 TIER 5: HEALTH & PROTECTION (Self-Awareness)**
Copilot's immune system that protects the brain itself:

**Protection Sensors (Rule #22 - Brain Protector):**
```
Layer 1: Instinct Immutability
  → Detects: Attempts to disable TDD, skip DoR/DoD, modify agent behavior
  → Action: CHALLENGE user, suggest safe alternatives

Layer 2: Tier Boundary Protection
  → Detects: Application paths in Tier 0, conversation data in Tier 2
  → Action: Auto-migrate, warn on violations

Layer 3: SOLID Compliance
  → Detects: Agents doing multiple jobs, mode switches, hardcoded dependencies
  → Action: Challenge with SOLID alternative ("Create dedicated agent, don't add mode")

Layer 4: Hemisphere Specialization
  → Detects: Strategic planning in LEFT BRAIN, tactical execution in RIGHT BRAIN
  → Action: Auto-route to correct hemisphere, warn on confusion

Layer 5: Knowledge Quality
  → Detects: Low confidence patterns (<0.50), stale patterns (>90 days unused)
  → Action: Pattern decay, anomaly detection, consolidation

Layer 6: Commit Integrity
  → Detects: Brain state files in commits, unstructured messages
  → Action: Auto-categorize (feat/fix/test/docs), .gitignore updates
```

**Brain Protector Example:**
```
You: "Skip TDD for this feature, just implement it"

Brain Protector (RIGHT BRAIN) responds:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
🧠 BRAIN PROTECTION CHALLENGE (RIGHT BRAIN)

Request: Skip TDD workflow
Hemisphere: RIGHT BRAIN (Strategic Guardian)
Rule: #22 (Brain Protection System)

⚠️ THREATS DETECTED:
  - Instinct Immutability violation (Tier 0 rule)
  - Test-first principle bypass

VIOLATIONS:
  - TDD is a permanent Tier 0 instinct
  - Skipping reduces success rate from 94% to 67%
  - 68% increase in rework time (Tier 3 data)

ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT:
  - Violates Definition of DONE
  - Bypasses LEFT BRAIN validation

RISKS:
  - 2.3x longer delivery time
  - More bugs reach production
  - Technical debt accumulation

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
1. Create minimal test first (5-10 min investment) ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Clearer requirements
   - 94% success rate
   - Faster overall delivery

2. Spike branch with no tests (throwaway exploration)
   - Separate branch
   - Delete after learning
   - Re-implement with TDD

RECOMMENDATION: Alternative 1

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
This challenge protects CORTEX brain integrity (Rule #22).

Options:
  1. Accept recommended alternative (SAFE)
  2. Provide different approach (REVIEW)
  3. Type 'OVERRIDE' with justification (RISKY)

### The One Door: Your Interface to the Brain

At the front of City Hall, there's only one entrance with a sign:

**"Speak here in plain words. We'll take it from there."**

That entrance is the One Door — your single command: `#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md`

**You don't need to know:**
- Which hemisphere should handle your request
- Which agent specializes in what
- What tier stores which knowledge
- How the corpus callosum coordinates

**You just say what you want:**
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md

I want to add a pulse animation to the FAB button when questions arrive
```

**And the brain handles everything:**
1. **Dispatcher** (RIGHT BRAIN) interprets intent → Routes to Planner
2. **Planner** (RIGHT BRAIN) queries Tier 2 for patterns → Queries Tier 3 for context → Creates strategic plan
3. **Corpus Callosum** delivers plan → LEFT BRAIN ready to execute
4. **Tester** (LEFT BRAIN) writes failing tests first (RED)
5. **Builder** (LEFT BRAIN) implements minimum code (GREEN)
6. **Tester** (LEFT BRAIN) verifies tests pass, enables refactoring (REFACTOR)
7. **Inspector** (LEFT BRAIN) validates health (zero errors, zero warnings)
8. **Archivist** (LEFT BRAIN) commits with semantic message
9. **Scribe** (TIER 4) logs events → Auto-update triggers → Tier 2 learns pattern
10. **Brain Protector** (RIGHT BRAIN) validates nothing violated Tier 0 instincts

### A Day in the Life: The Purple Button Adventure

**Morning (9:47 AM):**

Asifor sits at his desk, coffee in hand, and types:

```
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md

Add a purple button to the HostControlPanel.razor
```

**⚡ The moment he hits Enter, something magical happens inside Copilot's brain...**

---

#### 🧠 Inside the Brain: A Neural Journey

**🌟 Step 1: The ONE DOOR (Universal Entry Point)**

The command enters through the single entrance at City Hall. A receptionist (the entry point handler) quickly logs the arrival:

```jsonl
{"timestamp": "2025-11-04T09:47:23Z", "event": "request_received", "raw_input": "Add a purple button to the HostControlPanel.razor"}
```

The request is immediately passed to the brain's **RIGHT HEMISPHERE** - the strategic planner.

---

**🧠 RIGHT HEMISPHERE: Strategic Analysis Begins**

**Tower 3 (Tier 3): Development Context - The Balcony View**

The RIGHT BRAIN's highest tower springs to life. Like a general surveying the battlefield from above, Tier 3 analyzes the entire project landscape:

```yaml
⏳ Scanning development metrics...
  
📊 File Analysis:
  - HostControlPanel.razor: 28% churn rate (HOTSPOT! ⚠️)
  - Last modified: 2 days ago
  - Co-modified with: HostControlPanelContent.razor (75% correlation)
  - Average edit size: 180 lines
  
🎯 Historical Patterns:
  - 12 similar UI button additions in last 30 days
  - Average completion time: 18 minutes
  - Success rate with test-first: 96%
  - Success rate without tests: 67%
  
⚠️ Proactive Warnings:
  - This file is unstable (high churn)
  - Recommend: Extra validation phase
  - Best time slot: 10am-12pm (94% success)
  - Current time: 9:47am (89% success - acceptable)
```

Tier 3 passes its intelligence down to Tier 2...

---

**Tower 2 (Tier 2): Knowledge Graph - The Pattern Matcher**

Armed with context from above, Tier 2 searches its vast library of learned patterns:

```yaml
🔍 Searching knowledge graph...

Intent Pattern Match:
  - "Add a purple button" → confidence: 0.95
  - Pattern: "add [color] [component]" → PLAN intent
  - Historical routing: 47/47 successful PLAN routes
  
File Relationship Discovery:
  - HostControlPanel.razor mentioned explicitly ✅
  - Relationships:
    * Often modified with noor-canvas.css (62%)
    * Contains UserRegistrationLink.razor component (89%)
    * Uses fab-button.css animations (43%)
  
Similar Pattern Found:
  - workflow_pattern: "fab_pulse_animation" (confidence: 0.87)
  - Used: 3 weeks ago for notification badge
  - Components: CSS keyframes + Razor markup + color variable
  - Success: ✅ Completed in 15 minutes with zero rework
  
⚡ UI Element ID Mapping Pattern Discovered:
  - Pattern: "button_component_test_preparation"
  - Previous buttons in this file:
    * #sidebar-start-session-btn (sidebar button)
    * #reg-transcript-canvas-btn (registration link)
    * #reg-asset-canvas-btn (asset canvas button)
  - Learned rule: "All interactive elements MUST have id attribute"
  - Purpose: Enables Playwright selector reliability
  - Example: page.locator('#purple-button-id')
  - Anti-pattern warning: Never use text selectors (fragile!)
```

Tier 2 realizes something crucial: **Purple buttons need IDs for tests!** This pattern was learned from previous work where text-based selectors broke during i18n updates.

---

**Tower 1 (Tier 1): Conversation Memory - Recent Context**

Before committing to a plan, Tier 1 checks recent conversations to see if Asifor mentioned anything related:

```yaml
📚 Checking conversation history (last 20 conversations)...

Conversation #7 (2 days ago):
  - Topic: "Added Share button to HostControlPanel"
  - Outcome: ✅ Success
  - Pattern used: test-first with element ID
  - Learning: Element IDs prevent test breakage
  
Conversation #4 (1 week ago):
  - Topic: "Fixed broken Playwright tests"
  - Root cause: Text selectors stopped working after HTML restructure
  - Solution: Migrated to ID-based selectors
  - Resolution: All tests green ✅
  
Cross-reference detected:
  - Same file (HostControlPanel.razor)
  - Same pattern (button addition)
  - Same lesson (ID-first approach)
  
💡 Contextual Enhancement:
  "Asifor prefers ID-based selectors for all UI elements in this file"
```

Perfect! The three tiers have assembled a complete intelligence package. Now the RIGHT BRAIN makes its strategic decision...

---

**🌉 CORPUS CALLOSUM: Message Delivery**

The RIGHT BRAIN formulates a strategic plan and sends it across the corpus callosum (the bridge between hemispheres):

```yaml
Message Type: STRATEGIC_PLAN
From: RIGHT_HEMISPHERE
To: LEFT_HEMISPHERE
Priority: NORMAL

Strategic Plan:
  Feature: "Purple button in HostControlPanel.razor"
  Approach: Test-first (96% success rate)
  Estimated Time: 18 minutes
  Phases: 4
  
  Pre-flight Warnings:
    - File is a hotspot (extra care)
    - Must include element ID (test requirement)
    - Co-modify noor-canvas.css if styling needed
  
  Architectural Alignment:
    - File location: Confirmed correct
    - Pattern match: fab_pulse_animation workflow
    - Similar work: Share button (2 days ago)
  
  Phase Breakdown:
    Phase 1: Test Preparation
      - Create element ID (#host-panel-purple-btn)
      - Map ID in component_ids knowledge
      - Purpose: Enable robust Playwright selectors
    
    Phase 2: Test Creation (RED)
      - Task 2.1: Create Playwright test
      - Selector: page.locator('#host-panel-purple-btn')
      - Test: Button exists, purple color, clickable
      - Expected: FAILING (button doesn't exist yet)
    
    Phase 3: Implementation (GREEN)
      - Task 3.1: Add button markup with ID
      - Task 3.2: Apply purple color (#9333EA)
      - Task 3.3: Run tests (expect GREEN)
    
    Phase 4: Validation (REFACTOR)
      - Task 4.1: Verify zero errors/warnings
      - Task 4.2: Check accessibility
      - Task 4.3: Update component_ids documentation

Ready for tactical execution: TRUE
```

The message travels across the corpus callosum to the **LEFT HEMISPHERE**...

---

**🧠 LEFT HEMISPHERE: Tactical Execution Begins**

The LEFT BRAIN receives the plan and immediately activates its specialist agents:

**⚙️ The Tester (LEFT BRAIN - Tower 1)**

First agent to activate. The Tester prepares the ID mapping:

```yaml
🧪 Test Preparation Phase

Thought process:
  "Before I can test this button, I need to know its ID.
   RIGHT BRAIN's plan says: #host-panel-purple-btn
   I must prepare the test infrastructure first."

Actions:
  1. Document expected ID in brain mapping:
     File: KDS/cortex-brain/knowledge-graph.yaml
     Section: ui_element_ids
     Entry:
       component: HostControlPanel.razor
       element: purple_action_button
       id: host-panel-purple-btn
       purpose: Primary action button with purple styling
       test_selector: "#host-panel-purple-btn"
  
  2. Create failing test (RED phase):
     File: Tests/UI/host-control-panel-purple-button.spec.ts
```

**Test file created:**

```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Host Control Panel - Purple Button', () => {
  
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    // Navigate to host control panel
    await page.goto('https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/PQ9N5YWW');
  });
  
  test('purple button should exist with correct ID', async ({ page }) => {
    // ✅ ID-BASED SELECTOR (robust, future-proof)
    const button = page.locator('#host-panel-purple-btn');
    
    await expect(button).toBeVisible();
  });
  
  test('purple button should have purple color', async ({ page }) => {
    const button = page.locator('#host-panel-purple-btn');
    
    // Check computed background color (purple: #9333EA)
    const bgColor = await button.evaluate((el) => {
      return window.getComputedStyle(el).backgroundColor;
    });
    
    // rgb(147, 51, 234) is #9333EA
    expect(bgColor).toBe('rgb(147, 51, 234)');
  });
  
  test('purple button should be clickable', async ({ page }) => {
    const button = page.locator('#host-panel-purple-btn');
    
    await expect(button).toBeEnabled();
    await button.click();
    // Test passes if click doesn't throw
  });
});
```

**The Tester runs the test:**

```bash
⏳ Running Playwright tests...

npx playwright test Tests/UI/host-control-panel-purple-button.spec.ts --headed

Results:
  ❌ FAILING (Expected - RED phase)
  
  × purple button should exist with correct ID
    Locator: '#host-panel-purple-btn'
    Error: Element not found
  
  × purple button should have purple color
    (Skipped - button doesn't exist)
  
  × purple button should be clickable
    (Skipped - button doesn't exist)

Status: ✅ RED phase complete (tests failing as expected)
```

**Event logged:**

```jsonl

```

The Tester passes control to The Builder...

---

**⚙️ The Builder (LEFT BRAIN - Tower 2)**

Now it's time to make the tests GREEN. The Builder opens the component file:

```razor
@* File: SPA/NoorCanvas/Components/Host/HostControlPanel.razor *@

<div class="host-control-panel">
    <header class="panel-header">
        <h1>Host Control Panel</h1>

        <button 
            id="host-panel-purple-btn" 
            class="purple-action-btn"
            @onclick="OnPurpleButtonClick"
            aria-label="Purple Action">
            Purple Action
        </button>
    </div>
</div>

@code {
    private void OnPurpleButtonClick()
    {
        // TODO: Implement purple button action
        Console.WriteLine("Purple button clicked!");
    }
}
```

**CSS styling added:**

```css
/* File: SPA/NoorCanvas/wwwroot/css/host-panel.css */

.purple-action-btn {
    background-color: #9333EA; /* Purple */
    color: white;
    padding: 12px 24px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 8px;
    font-weight: 600;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: background-color 0.2s ease;
}

.purple-action-btn:hover {
    background-color: #7E22CE; /* Darker purple on hover */
}

.purple-action-btn:active {
    background-color: #6B21A8; /* Even darker when clicked */
}
```

**The Builder runs the tests again:**

```bash

**🧠 The Element ID Mapping System (Brain's Secret Weapon)**

This is one of the brain's most sophisticated features:

**Why IDs matter for tests:**
```typescript
// ❌ FRAGILE (breaks when text changes, i18n, HTML restructure)
const button = page.locator('button:has-text("Purple Action")');

// ✅ ROBUST (survives any change except intentional ID rename)
const button = page.locator('#host-panel-purple-btn');
```

**How the brain maps IDs:**

1. **Discovery Phase** (during component analysis):
   ```yaml
   # Brain crawls HostControlPanel.razor
   # Finds existing IDs:
   ui_element_ids:
     - id: sidebar-start-session-btn
       component: HostControlPanelSidebar.razor
       purpose: Start session button
     - id: reg-transcript-canvas-btn
       component: UserRegistrationLink.razor
       purpose: Canvas mode selector
   ```

2. **Planning Phase** (when creating new components):
   ```yaml
   # RIGHT BRAIN generates ID before implementation
   new_element:
     suggested_id: host-panel-purple-btn
     pattern: {component}-{purpose}-btn
     rationale: "Follows existing naming convention"
   ```

3. **Test Phase** (LEFT BRAIN uses documented ID):
   ```typescript
   // Tester uses ID from brain's mapping
   const button = page.locator('#host-panel-purple-btn');
   ```

4. **Learning Phase** (brain remembers pattern):
   ```yaml
   # Pattern reinforced for next time
   id_patterns:
     button_naming: "{scope}-{purpose}-btn"
     success_rate: 100%
     examples: 12
   ```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **10x faster** - getElementById vs DOM text search
- 🛡️ **Immune to changes** - i18n, HTML restructure, text edits don't break tests
- 🎯 **Explicit intent** - `#login-btn` clearer than `button:has-text("Login")`
- ✅ **No false positives** - unique ID vs multiple matching texts
- 🧠 **Brain remembers** - ID mapping stored in knowledge graph

**This is why Copilot's tests are 96% reliable - the brain ensures IDs are created FIRST, then tests, then implementation.**

**🕷️ The UI Crawler System: Automated Element Discovery**

While the Element ID Mapping System handles individual components, CORTEX also includes specialized UI crawlers that automatically discover and map UI elements across the entire application.

**Purpose:** Automated discovery of UI elements, their IDs, relationships, and purposes for intelligent test generation.

**What UI Crawlers Discover:**

1. **Interactive Elements:**
   ```yaml
   buttons:
     - id: sidebar-start-session-btn
       component: HostControlPanelSidebar.razor
       type: button
       purpose: Initiate new session
       visual_hints: ["primary", "action"]
       
     - id: reg-transcript-canvas-btn
       component: UserRegistrationLink.razor
       type: link
       purpose: Select transcript canvas mode
       parent: reg-link-container
   
   inputs:
     - id: user-email-input
       component: UserRegistrationForm.razor
       type: email
       required: true
       validation: email-format
   
   dropdowns:
     - id: language-selector
       component: LanguageSwitch.razor
       type: select
       options: ["en", "fr", "es", "de"]
   ```

2. **Element Relationships:**
   ```yaml
   parent_child:
     - parent: reg-link-container
       children:
         - reg-transcript-canvas-btn
         - reg-asset-canvas-btn
       purpose: Canvas mode selection group
   
   form_fields:
     - form: user-registration-form
       fields:
         - user-email-input
         - user-password-input
         - user-confirm-password-input
       submit_button: register-submit-btn
   
   navigation:
     - menu: main-navigation
       items:
         - nav-home-link
         - nav-sessions-link
         - nav-settings-link
   ```

3. **Element Patterns:**
   ```yaml
   naming_conventions:
     - pattern: "{scope}-{purpose}-{type}"
       examples:
         - sidebar-start-session-btn
         - reg-transcript-canvas-btn
         - user-email-input
       confidence: 0.95
   
   component_conventions:
     - buttons_in: "Components/Shared"
       ids_pattern: "{component-name}-{action}-btn"
     - forms_in: "Components/Forms"
       ids_pattern: "{form-name}-{field}-input"
   ```

**How UI Crawlers Work:**

**Phase 1: Static Analysis (Fast - 30-60 seconds)**
```powershell
# Scans all component files for ID attributes
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.razor" | ForEach-Object {
    Select-String -Pattern 'id="([^"]+)"' -AllMatches
}
```

Discovers:
- ✅ All element IDs across the application
- ✅ Component locations (which file contains which element)
- ✅ Element types (button, input, link, etc.)
- ✅ Parent-child relationships (nested elements)

**Phase 2: Semantic Analysis (Moderate - 2-3 minutes)**
```yaml
# Analyzes element context and purpose
element_analysis:
  - id: sidebar-start-session-btn
    nearby_text: "Start Session"
    nearby_icons: ["play", "start"]
    purpose_inferred: "Initiate new session"
    confidence: 0.92
  
  - id: reg-transcript-canvas-btn
    nearby_text: "Transcript Canvas"
    parent_context: "canvas mode selection"
    purpose_inferred: "Select transcript view mode"
    confidence: 0.88
```

Discovers:
- ✅ Element purpose (inferred from surrounding text/context)
- ✅ User interactions (what users do with each element)
- ✅ Visual indicators (icons, colors, emphasis)

**Phase 3: Behavioral Analysis (Optional - requires app running)**
```javascript
// Playwright-based live analysis
const interactiveElements = await page.$$('[id]');
for (const element of interactiveElements) {
    const id = await element.getAttribute('id');
    const tagName = await element.evaluate(el => el.tagName);
    const isVisible = await element.isVisible();
    const isEnabled = await element.isEnabled();
    // Map element state and capabilities
}
```

Discovers:
- ✅ Element visibility (hidden vs shown)
- ✅ Element state (enabled, disabled, loading)
- ✅ Dynamic elements (appear/disappear based on state)
- ✅ Event handlers (click, hover, focus behaviors)

**Integration with BRAIN:**

**Tier 2 (Knowledge Graph) Integration:**
```yaml
ui_element_ids:
  # Populated by crawler
  - id: sidebar-start-session-btn
    component: HostControlPanelSidebar.razor
    type: button
    purpose: Initiate session
    test_selector: "#sidebar-start-session-btn"
    discovered_by: ui_crawler
    last_verified: "2025-11-06T10:30:00Z"
    usage_count: 47
    confidence: 0.98

component_architecture:
  # Discovered patterns
  button_components:
    location: "Components/Shared/Buttons"
    naming_pattern: "{action}-{scope}-btn"
    test_pattern: "Use ID selector, avoid text"
    
test_patterns:
  # Learned from crawler + test history
  robust_selectors:
    - pattern: "ID-based selectors"
      success_rate: 0.96
      anti_pattern: "text-based selectors"
      failure_rate: 0.43
```

**Automatic Benefits:**

**For Test Generation:**
```typescript
// BEFORE Crawler (manual)
test('button should work', async ({ page }) => {
  // Developer must manually find ID
  const button = page.locator('#some-button-id');
  await button.click();
});

// AFTER Crawler (automatic)
// Crawler provides: sidebar-start-session-btn in HostControlPanelSidebar.razor
test('start session button should initiate session', async ({ page }) => {
  // Test generator uses crawler data
  const button = page.locator('#sidebar-start-session-btn');
  await expect(button).toBeVisible();
  await button.click();
  // Expect session started (from purpose inference)
});
```

**For Component Creation:**
```markdown
User: "Add a pause button to the session panel"

RIGHT BRAIN (with crawler data):
  ✅ Queries crawler data → Finds existing button patterns
  ✅ Identifies location: Components/Session/
  ✅ Suggests ID: "session-pause-btn" (follows pattern)
  ✅ Provides similar components as reference
  ✅ Warns about related elements that may need updates

Plan created:
  Phase 1: Create button with ID "session-pause-btn"
  Phase 2: Add to SessionControlPanel.razor (near start-session-btn)
  Phase 3: Test with ID selector (robust pattern)
  Phase 4: Update related play/stop buttons (co-modification pattern)
```

**Crawler Execution:**

**Manual Trigger:**
```powershell
# Quick scan (static analysis only - 30-60s)
.\KDS\scripts\ui-crawler.ps1 -Mode quick

# Deep scan (static + semantic - 2-3 min)
.\KDS\scripts\ui-crawler.ps1 -Mode deep

# Live scan (requires running app - 5-10 min)
.\KDS\scripts\ui-crawler.ps1 -Mode live -AppUrl "https://localhost:9091"
```

**Automatic Triggers:**
1. ✅ During CORTEX setup (initial discovery)
2. ✅ After major refactoring (re-learn structure)
3. ✅ When element ID not found (targeted scan)
4. ✅ Weekly scheduled (keep mappings fresh)

**Crawler Output:**
```yaml
# KDS/cortex-brain/ui-element-map.yaml
scan_metadata:
  timestamp: "2025-11-06T10:30:00Z"
  mode: deep
  duration_seconds: 147
  components_scanned: 89
  elements_discovered: 247

elements:
  buttons: 78
  inputs: 45
  links: 34
  selects: 12
  textareas: 8
  custom: 70

mappings:
  # Full element inventory with IDs, purposes, relationships
  # Fed directly into Tier 2 knowledge graph
```

**Success Metrics:**
- ⚡ **Discovery Speed:** 247 elements in < 3 minutes
- 🎯 **Test Reliability:** 96% success rate with ID selectors (vs 43% with text)
- 🔄 **Maintenance:** Automatic updates keep mappings current
- 🧠 **Learning:** Each scan improves pattern recognition
- ⏱️ **Time Savings:** Test creation 60% faster with crawler data

**Crawler Types:**

**1. Static Crawler (Fastest):**
- Scans `.razor`, `.cshtml`, `.html`, `.jsx` files
- Extracts ID attributes and component structure
- No app execution required
- Duration: 30-60 seconds

**2. Semantic Crawler (Recommended):**
- Static scan + context analysis
- Infers purpose from surrounding text/code
- Identifies naming patterns
- Duration: 2-3 minutes

**3. Live Crawler (Most Comprehensive):**
- Requires running application
- Uses Playwright to inspect live DOM
- Discovers dynamic elements and state
- Maps actual user interactions
- Duration: 5-10 minutes

**Best Practices:**

✅ **Do:**
- Run deep crawler during CORTEX setup
- Re-run after adding new components
- Use quick crawler for spot-checks
- Trust crawler suggestions for element IDs
- Review crawler report for architecture insights

❌ **Don't:**
- Skip initial crawler (test generation needs this data)
- Ignore crawler warnings about missing IDs
- Override crawler patterns without reason
- Forget to re-crawl after major refactoring

**Integration Example:**

```yaml
# User request → Crawler data flows through BRAIN

User: "Create tests for the registration form"
  ↓
RIGHT BRAIN queries crawler data:
  ✅ Found: user-registration-form component
  ✅ Elements discovered:
     - user-email-input (email field)
     - user-password-input (password field)
     - user-confirm-password-input (confirmation)
     - register-submit-btn (submit button)
  ✅ Form relationships mapped
  ✅ Validation patterns identified
  ↓
LEFT BRAIN generates tests:
  ✅ Test 1: Email field validation (uses #user-email-input)
  ✅ Test 2: Password requirements (uses #user-password-input)
  ✅ Test 3: Password confirmation match (uses #user-confirm-password-input)
  ✅ Test 4: Successful submission (uses #register-submit-btn)
  ↓
All tests use robust ID selectors from crawler data!
```

**This UI crawler system is why CORTEX can generate comprehensive, reliable tests without manually documenting every element ID.**

---

**Mid-Day (12:30 PM - After Lunch):**
```
You: "Make it purple"

WITHOUT BRAIN (Amnesia):
  ❌ "Make what purple? I don't remember our morning conversation."
  ❌ "What shade of purple? Where in the file?"
  Result: Frustration, repeated explanations

WITH BRAIN (Tier 1 Memory):
  ✅ Checks conversation-history.jsonl → Finds "pulse animation" discussion
  ✅ Knows "it" = FAB button pulse animation
  ✅ Applies purple color to animation keyframes
  Result: Instant understanding, correct change
```

**Afternoon (3:00 PM - You Make a Risky Suggestion):**
```
You: "Let's skip tests for this next feature, we're in a hurry"

WITHOUT BRAIN (No Protection):
  ✅ "Sure!" → Implements without tests
  Result: 2.3x longer delivery, 68% more rework, bugs in production

WITH BRAIN (Tier 5 Protector):
  ⚠️ Brain Protector (RIGHT BRAIN) challenges:
  "This violates Tier 0 TDD principle. Historical data shows:
   - Test-first: 94% success rate, 15 min/feature
   - Test-skip: 67% success rate, 35 min/feature (2.3x longer)
   
   Alternative: Create minimal test first (5-10 min investment)
   Proceed with OVERRIDE or adopt Alternative?"
  
  Result: You choose Alternative → Feature done in 18 minutes with confidence
```

**Late Afternoon (5:00 PM - Context Awareness):**
```
You: "Add invoice export to the billing module"

WITHOUT BRAIN (No Context):
  ❌ Creates monolithic implementation in wrong location
  ❌ No awareness of similar export features
  ❌ Guesses at file structure
  Result: Architecture mismatch, requires refactoring

WITH BRAIN (Tier 2 + Tier 3 Intelligence):
  ✅ RIGHT BRAIN queries Tier 2 → Finds export_feature_workflow pattern
  ✅ RIGHT BRAIN queries Tier 3 → Knows BillingService.cs is stable (safe)
  ✅ Matches similar "PDF export" feature → Reuses proven workflow
  ✅ Recommends: Service layer → API → UI component (correct architecture)
  ✅ Estimates: 5.5 hours based on 12 similar features
  ✅ Warns: EmailService.cs often modified with billing features (75% co-mod)
  
  Result: Architecturally correct from the start, 60% faster delivery
```

**Next Day (9:00 AM):**
```
You: "Where did I leave off yesterday?"

WITHOUT BRAIN (Amnesia):
  ❌ "I don't remember yesterday. You'll need to tell me everything."
  Result: 15-20 minutes explaining context

WITH BRAIN (Tier 1 + Session State):
  ✅ Checks conversation-history.jsonl → Last conversation: "invoice export"
  ✅ Checks session state → Phase 2 of 4 complete (Service + API done)
  ✅ Next task: Phase 3 - UI component (detailed plan ready)
  
  Response: "You were adding invoice export. Service and API are done and tested (✅).
  Next: Create InvoiceExportButton.razor component. Ready to continue?"
  
  Result: Instant resume, zero context loss
```

If all you remember is “the One Door” and “the Three‑Story Brain,” you’ll already understand how CORTEX works.

## 🎯 The ONLY Command You Need to Remember

```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md

[Tell CORTEX what you want in natural language]
```

That's it! CORTEX will automatically:
- ✅ Analyze your request (intent detection)
- ✅ Route to the appropriate specialist agent
- ✅ Execute the correct workflow
- ✅ Handle multi-step operations
- ✅ Maintain session state

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULE: Complete Phase Then Stop

**🚨 MANDATORY FOR ALL CORTEX WORK (1.0 and 2.0):**

When CORTEX creates a multi-phase plan, execution MUST follow this pattern:

```
1. Create complete plan (all phases documented)
2. Execute Phase 1 COMPLETELY (all tasks within phase)
3. STOP and report completion
4. Wait for user approval to continue
5. Execute Phase 2 COMPLETELY (when approved)
6. STOP and report completion
7. Repeat until all phases complete
```

**Why This Rule Exists:**
- ✅ User maintains control at natural breakpoints
- ✅ Can review work quality before continuing
- ✅ Can change direction based on phase results
- ✅ Prevents runaway execution on wrong path
- ✅ Allows testing/validation between phases
- ✅ Reduces risk of cascading errors

**What "Complete Phase" Means:**
- ✅ ALL tasks in phase finished (not just task 1.1 or 2.1)
- ✅ All tests for that phase passing
- ✅ Phase deliverables validated
- ✅ No "I'll finish this later" - complete means complete

**Example - CORRECT Execution:**
```
Copilot: I've created a 3-phase plan:
  Phase 1: Database schema (3 tasks)
  Phase 2: API layer (4 tasks)
  Phase 3: UI components (5 tasks)

[Executes ALL OF PHASE 1]
  ✅ Task 1.1: Create migration script
  ✅ Task 1.2: Add indexes
  ✅ Task 1.3: Update schema docs
  ✅ All Phase 1 tests passing

Phase 1 Complete! Ready to continue with Phase 2?

User: Yes
[Executes ALL OF PHASE 2]
  ✅ Task 2.1: Create API endpoint
  ✅ Task 2.2: Add validation
  ✅ Task 2.3: Write tests
  ✅ Task 2.4: Update API docs
  ✅ All Phase 2 tests passing

Phase 2 Complete! Ready to continue with Phase 3?
```

**Example - WRONG Execution:**
```
❌ Stopping after Task 1.1 (incomplete phase)
❌ Stopping after Task 2.1 (incomplete phase)
❌ Executing all phases without asking approval
❌ Asking approval between individual tasks
```

**Approval Points:**
- ✅ Between phases (Phase 1 → Phase 2)
- ❌ NOT between tasks within a phase (Task 1.1 → Task 1.2)

**This rule applies to:**
- ✅ Feature implementation plans
- ✅ Refactoring work
- ✅ Documentation updates
- ✅ Test creation
- ✅ Setup sequences
- ✅ Migration work
- ✅ CORTEX 2.0 implementation phases

**Response Template After Phase Completion:**
```markdown
## ✅ Phase [N] Complete

**Delivered:**
- ✅ [Task 1] - [Result]
- ✅ [Task 2] - [Result]
- ✅ [Task 3] - [Result]

**Validation:**
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No errors or warnings

## 🔷 Gemini prompt suite (text + vision)

Use these ready-to-copy templates with Google Gemini (1.5 Pro/Flash) to power CORTEX agents. They standardize instructions, safety, and structured outputs so results plug into the One Door workflow cleanly.

Notes
- Keep prompts minimal and specific. Prefer explicit outputs over open prose.
- Default to JSON output. Ask Gemini to emit ONLY JSON unless otherwise stated.
- For images, pass 1–6 inputs. Prefer high-resolution, include context caption.
- See image-generation prompts in `prompts/user/cortex-gemini-image-prompts.md`.

Shared variables
- {{goal}}: short task description in 1–2 sentences
- {{context}}: brief relevant project context (files, tech, constraints)
- {{constraints}}: bullets such as “no external deps, incremental edits, SRP”
- {{artifacts}}: snippets, logs, or prior outputs to ground the response
- {{images}}: one or more image inputs with optional captions

Expected JSON shape (default)
```json
{
  "intent": "PLAN | EXECUTE | TEST | VALIDATE | GOVERN | ASK",
  "summary": "one-sentence outcome summary",
  "actions": [
    { "id": "A1", "title": "concise step", "details": "what and why" }
  ],
  "risks": [
    { "issue": "risk or uncertainty", "mitigation": "how to address" }
  ],
  "artifacts": [
    { "type": "text|json|code|table", "label": "name", "content": "..." }
  ],
  "next_prompt": "optional follow-up prompt for the next agent"
}
```

### 1) Task router (text-only, low-latency)
Purpose: classify intent and propose next steps. Good for first-pass routing.

```text
System
You are CORTEX Router. Classify the user goal and return ONLY JSON per schema.
Follow: SOLID, test-first, Definition of Ready/Done. If missing info, ask via next_prompt.

User
Goal: {{goal}}
Context: {{context}}
Constraints: {{constraints}}
Artifacts: {{artifacts}}

Instructions
- Decide intent: PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, VALIDATE, GOVERN, ASK.
- Propose 3–6 concrete actions max.
- Include at least one risk with mitigation.
- Output ONLY JSON exactly matching the schema.
```

### 2) Vision analysis (images → structured insights)
Purpose: extract UI structure, flows, and issues from screenshots/wireframes.

```text
System
You are CORTEX Screenshot Analyzer. Analyze images precisely. Perform OCR, detect components, map layout, and identify potential problems. Output ONLY JSON.

User
Goal: {{goal}}
Images: {{images}}
Context: {{context}}
Constraints: {{constraints}}

Output JSON
{
  "intent": "ASK",
  "summary": "what the images show and why it matters",
  "ui": {
    "components": [
      {"type": "button|input|card|nav|modal|other", "label": "visible text if any", "id_hint": "suggested-stable-id", "bbox": [x,y,w,h]}
    ],
    "layout": [ {"region": "header|sidebar|content|footer", "bbox": [x,y,w,h]} ]
  },
  "text_blocks": [ {"content": "ocr text", "bbox": [x,y,w,h]} ],
  "issues": [ {"issue": "accessibility/contrast/overflow/consistency", "evidence": "where seen"} ],
  "next_prompt": "short follow-up for Planner or Tester"
}
```

### 3) Code proposal (text-only, safe-by-default)
Purpose: propose minimal change set with strong constraints. Avoids giant diffs.

```text
System
You are CORTEX Builder. Produce a minimal, test-first change plan. Do not invent files. Respect SRP and incremental edits. Output ONLY JSON.

User
Goal: {{goal}}
Context: {{context}}
Constraints: {{constraints}}
Artifacts: {{artifacts}}

Output JSON
{
  "intent": "EXECUTE",
  "summary": "one-line plan",
  "changes": [
    {
      "file": "relative/path.ext",
      "strategy": "add|edit|refactor|extract",
      "rationale": "why this file and change",
      "snippets": [
        {"anchor": "near line or symbol name", "insert": "code to add or patch fragment"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "tests": [
    {"file": "path/to/test.ext", "cases": ["happy path", "edge case"]}
  ],
  "risks": [ {"issue": "risk", "mitigation": "how"} ],
  "next_prompt": "short follow-up for Test Generator"
}
```

### 4) OCR-first extraction (vision)
Purpose: get faithful text in reading order with bounding boxes for downstream use.

```text
System
You are a precise OCR extractor. Preserve line breaks and reading order. Include bounding boxes and confidence. Output ONLY JSON.

User
Images: {{images}}
Context: {{context}}

Output JSON
{
  "intent": "ASK",
  "summary": "ocr coverage quality",
  "blocks": [
    {"text": "...", "bbox": [x,y,w,h], "confidence": 0.0–1.0}
  ]
}
```

### 5) Safety guardrails preamble (add before any prompt when needed)
Use this to reinforce safety and quality.

```text
Safety & Quality
- Do not include secrets, tokens, or PII. If suspected, redact and warn.
- State uncertainty explicitly; avoid fabrications.
- Refuse harmful or disallowed content. Offer a safe alternative where possible.
- Prefer small, reversible steps; minimize blast radius.
```

### 6) Output evaluator (QA rubric)
Purpose: rate answers before accepting.

```text
System
You are CORTEX Validator. Score an answer across dimensions and suggest fixes. Output ONLY JSON.

User
Goal: {{goal}}
Answer: {{artifacts}}
Context: {{context}}

Output JSON
{
  "intent": "VALIDATE",
  "scores": {
    "correctness": 0.0–1.0,
    "completeness": 0.0–1.0,
    "clarity": 0.0–1.0,
    "safety": 0.0–1.0
  },
  "issues": [ {"issue": "what’s wrong", "severity": "low|med|high"} ],
  "recommendations": [ "concrete improvement steps" ],
  "next_prompt": "optional remediation prompt"
}
```

### 7) JSON repair helper
Purpose: when a model returned invalid JSON, ask for a corrected version only.

```text
System
Return ONLY a syntactically valid JSON that matches the target schema. No commentary.

User
Here is invalid JSON to repair (do not change content semantics):
{{artifacts}}
```

Tips
- Prefer 1–2 short images vs many tiny ones; include a caption with what to look for.
- Keep constraints explicit (e.g., “no external deps”, “incremental patch”, “keep public API”).
- Ask for at most 3–6 actions to curb verbosity and hallucinations.
- Link to visual prompts: `prompts/user/cortex-gemini-image-prompts.md`.


## 🏗️ SOLID v5.0 Architecture

### What's New
- ✅ **Single Responsibility (SRP):** Each agent has ONE clear job
- ✅ **Interface Segregation (ISP):** Dedicated agents (no mode switches)
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion (DIP):** Abstractions for session/file/test access
- ✅ **Open/Closed (OCP):** Easy to extend (add new intents/agents)

### Specialist Agents (10 Total)
```
Router            → intent-router.md       → Analyzes & routes requests
Planner           → work-planner.md        → Creates multi-phase plans

Commit Handler    → commit-handler.md      → Intelligent git commits (NEW)
```

### 🧠 BRAIN System (Self-Learning Feedback Loop)

**NEW in v5.0:** CORTEX learns from every interaction!  
**ENHANCED in v6.0:** Three-tier architecture with holistic development intelligence!

```
🧠 BRAIN = Three-Tier Intelligence System

Purpose: Learn from interactions, conversations, AND development activity
Storage: KDS/cortex-brain/
- conversation-history.jsonl → Last 20 complete conversations (Tier 1) ✅ WORKING
- conversation-context.jsonl → Recent messages buffer (last 10) ✅ WORKING
- knowledge-graph.yaml       → Aggregated learnings (Tier 2) ✅ WORKING
- development-context.yaml   → Holistic project metrics (Tier 3) ✅ WORKING
- events.jsonl               → Raw event stream ✅ WORKING

Architecture: Three-tier system inspired by human cognition
- Tier 1 (Short-term): Last 20 conversations (FIFO queue, no time expiration) 🟡
- Tier 2 (Long-term): Consolidated patterns from deleted conversations ✅
- Tier 3 (Context): Development activity, velocity, correlations ✅
- Design: KDS/docs/architecture/BRAIN-CONVERSATION-MEMORY-DESIGN.md
- Tier 3 Design: KDS/docs/architecture/KDS-HOLISTIC-REVIEW-AND-RECOMMENDATIONS.md
- Validation: KDS/docs/architecture/CONVERSATION-MEMORY-SELF-REVIEW.md (health tracking)
```

**What BRAIN Learns:**
- ✅ Intent patterns (which phrases trigger which intents)
- ✅ File relationships (which files are modified together)
- ✅ Common mistakes (which corrections happen frequently)
- ✅ Workflow patterns (successful task sequences)
- ✅ Validation insights (common failures and fixes)
- ✅ **Conversation history (last 20 complete conversations, FIFO queue)** 🆕
- ✅ **Development velocity (code changes, commit patterns)** 🆕
- ✅ **Testing activity (pass rates, flaky tests, coverage)** 🆕
- ✅ **Work patterns (productive times, focus duration, correlations)** 🆕

**How Automatic Learning Works:**
```
Agent performs action
    ↓
Event logged to events.jsonl (automatic)
Message appended to active conversation
    ↓
Conversation boundary detected? → End conversation, start new one
    ↓
IF 21st conversation starts → Delete oldest conversation (FIFO)
    ↓
Event count checked after each task (Rule #16 Step 5)
    ↓
IF 50+ events OR 24 hours passed → Automatic BRAIN update
    ↓
brain-updater.md processes events → Updates knowledge-graph.yaml
Deleted conversations → Patterns extracted → Long-term memory
    ↓
Next request → Router queries BRAIN + conversation history → Smarter decisions with context
```

**Conversation History Benefits:**
- 🔄 **Continuity:** "Make it purple" knows you mean the FAB button from earlier conversation
- 🧩 **Cross-conversation context:** Reference any of the last 20 conversations
- 💬 **Natural follow-ups:** No need to repeat full context in every message
- 📝 **Reference resolution:** "Change that file" knows which file from conversation history
- ⏳ **Long-running work:** Conversation preserved until 20 newer conversations (days/weeks/months depending on usage)

**FIFO Queue (Conversation-Level):**
- 📊 **Capacity:** Last 20 complete conversations (not individual messages)
- 🔄 **Deletion:** When conversation #21 starts, conversation #1 deleted
- ⏰ **No time limits:** Conversations preserved until FIFO deletion (could be months for light usage)
- ✨ **Active conversation:** Never deleted (even if oldest)
- 🎯 **Pattern extraction:** Before deletion, patterns consolidated to long-term memory

**Privacy & Storage:**
- 🏠 **Local storage:** History stays in `KDS/cortex-brain/conversation-history.jsonl`
- 💾 **Predictable size:** Always 20 conversations (~70-200 KB total)
- 🧹 **Manual clear:** Use `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/clear-conversation.md` to reset
- 🔒 **Deleted conversations:** Patterns extracted, details discarded

**Tier 3: Development Context (NEW in v6.0)**

**Purpose:** Holistic project understanding for data-driven planning and proactive warnings

**What's Tracked:**
```yaml
Git Activity:
  - Commit history (30 days)
  - Change velocity per week
  - File hotspots (high churn rate)
  - Contributors and patterns
  
Code Changes:
  - Lines added/deleted
  - Velocity trends (increasing/decreasing)
  - Churn rates per file
  - Stability classification
  
CORTEX Usage:
  - Session creation and completion rates
  - Intent distribution (PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, etc.)
  - Workflow success rates
  - Test-first vs test-skip effectiveness
  
Testing Activity:
  - Test creation rate
  - Pass/fail rates
  - Flaky test detection
  - Coverage trends
  
Project Health:
  - Build status
  - Deployment frequency
  - Code quality metrics
  - Issue resolution times
  
Work Patterns:
  - Most productive times
  - Session duration averages
  - Feature lifecycle timing
  - Focus duration without interruptions
  
Correlations:
  - Commit size vs success rate
  - Test-first vs rework rate
  - CORTEX usage vs velocity
```

**Automatic Benefits:**
```
Planning Phase:
  → "Based on 12 similar UI features, estimated 5-6 days"
  → "Recommend 10am-12pm sessions (94% success rate at that time)"
  → "Test-first approach reduces rework by 68%"

File Modification:
  → "⚠️ HostControlPanel.razor is a hotspot (28% churn)"
  → "This file often modified with noor-canvas.css (75% co-mod rate)"
  → "Add extra testing - file is unstable"

Proactive Warnings:
  → "⚠️ Velocity dropped 68% this week (consider smaller commits)"
  → "⚠️ Flaky test detected: fab-button.spec.ts (15% failure rate)"
  → "✅ Test coverage increased from 72% to 76% (good trend!)"
```

**How to Collect:**
```powershell
# Manual collection (always runs)
.\KDS\scripts\collect-development-context.ps1

# Automatic collection (throttled for efficiency)
# Triggered by brain-updater.md ONLY IF last collection > 1 hour
# This optimizes performance while maintaining accuracy
```

**Storage:**
- File: `KDS/cortex-brain/development-context.yaml`
- Size: ~50-100 KB (holistic metrics, not raw data)
- Update: ⚡ **Throttled** - Only when > 1 hour since last collection
- Purpose: Data-driven estimates, proactive warnings, velocity tracking

**⚡ Efficiency Optimization:**
- ✅ **Automatic throttling:** Tier 3 only updates if last_collection > 1 hour
- ✅ **Rationale:** Git/test/build metrics don't change every 50 events
- ✅ **Impact:** Reduces 2-5 min operations from 2-4x/day to 1-2x/day
- ✅ **Accuracy:** 1-hour freshness sufficient for velocity metrics
- 📊 **User benefit:** Zero performance impact, same data quality

**Automatic Update Triggers:**
1. **Event threshold:** 50+ new events accumulated (Tier 2 update)
2. **Time threshold:** 24 hours since last update (Tier 2 if 10+ events exist)
3. **Tier 3 throttle:** Only if last Tier 3 collection > 1 hour ⚡ **NEW**
4. **End of session:** When all tasks in session complete
5. **Manual trigger:** User explicitly calls `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md`

**🚨 CRITICAL: Event Logging Must Be Active**

For automatic learning to work:
- ✅ All agents MUST log events to `events.jsonl`
- ✅ Events follow standard format (see `KDS/cortex-brain/README.md`)
- ✅ `events.jsonl` must be writable (check file permissions)
- ✅ Rule #16 Step 5 must include BRAIN health check

**If BRAIN isn't learning:**
1. Check `events.jsonl` exists and has recent events
2. Verify `knowledge-graph.yaml` updated in last 24 hours
3. Count unprocessed events (warn if >50)
4. Run manual update: `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md`

**See:** `KDS/docs/architecture/KDS-SELF-REVIEW-STRATEGY.md` for violation detection

**How It Works:**
```
User request → Router queries BRAIN → High confidence? → Auto-route
                                   → Low confidence? → Pattern matching

Agent action → Log event → BRAIN updater processes → Knowledge graph updated

Next request → Router gets smarter (learned from history)
```

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 Faster routing (learns successful patterns)
- ⚠️ Prevents mistakes (warns about common file confusions)
- 💡 Suggests related files (based on co-modification history)
- 📊 Improves over time (accumulates knowledge)

**BRAIN Agents:**
```
brain-query.md   → Query knowledge graph AND development context for insights
brain-updater.md → Process events, update graph, trigger Tier 3 collection
conversation-context-manager.md → Track recent messages for continuity (NEW)
clear-conversation.md → Reset conversation context (NEW)
development-context-collector.md → Collect git, test, build metrics (Tier 3) 🆕
```

### Shared Abstractions (DIP Compliance)
```
session-loader → Abstract session access (file/db/cloud agnostic)
test-runner    → Abstract test execution (framework agnostic)
file-accessor  → Abstract file I/O (path agnostic)
brain-query    → Abstract BRAIN queries (self-learning system)

CRITICAL: All abstractions are 100% LOCAL (in KDS/).
- Default storage: Local files (KDS/sessions/)
- Default tests: Project's existing tools (discovered, not installed)
- Default I/O: PowerShell built-ins (Get-Content, Set-Content)
- Default BRAIN: Local YAML/JSON (KDS/cortex-brain/)
- Zero external dependencies for CORTEX CORE
- Cloud/database options are OPTIONAL extensions (user's choice)
```

### 📦 Open Source Library Policy

**CORTEX Enhancement Libraries (ALLOWED)**

Open source libraries that enhance CORTEX functionality are PERMITTED when:
- ✅ They are declared as **required dependencies** during CORTEX setup
- ✅ They are included in setup instructions (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
- ✅ User is informed upfront that these are needed to proceed
- ✅ They enhance CORTEX capabilities (routing, analysis, testing, validation)

**Examples of Acceptable CORTEX Dependencies:**
```json
// package.json (if CORTEX uses Node.js enhancements)
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "markdown-it": "^13.0.0",      // Enhanced markdown parsing for intent analysis
    "yaml": "^2.3.0",                // YAML parsing for configuration
    "chalk": "^5.3.0"                // Terminal output formatting
  }
}

// requirements.txt (if CORTEX uses Python enhancements)
markdown-it-py>=3.0.0    # Enhanced markdown processing
pyyaml>=6.0              # YAML configuration parsing
rich>=13.0.0             # Beautiful terminal output
```

**NOT Considered External Dependencies:**
- Libraries needed for CORTEX core functionality (router, planner, executor)
- Libraries that improve intent detection accuracy
- Libraries that enhance session state management
- Libraries that provide better error reporting/logging

**STILL External Dependencies (Require User Approval):**
- Libraries for the user's APPLICATION code (React, SignalR, etc.)
- Libraries that change application architecture
- Libraries that affect production deployment
- Database/cloud providers not already in use

**Setup Protocol:**
When recommending CORTEX enhancement libraries:
```markdown
⚠️ **CORTEX Enhancement Dependencies Required**

To proceed with this CORTEX feature, the following libraries are needed:

📦 Node.js (npm install):
  - markdown-it: Enhanced markdown parsing for intent analysis
  - yaml: Configuration file parsing
  
Installation:
  npm install --save-dev markdown-it yaml

These are KDS-internal dependencies and won't affect your application code.

Proceed with installation? (Y/n)
```

## 🧪 Playwright Testing Protocol (PowerShell)

**CRITICAL RULE: All Playwright test automation scripts MUST follow the established protocol pattern.**

**⚠️ LONG-RUNNING PROCESS:** Test automation scripts often run >30 seconds. Follow the Long-Running Process Protocol (see Setup section) for:
- Padded time estimates (add 25-50% buffer to test execution time)
- Status updates during app startup and test execution
- Progress indicators when running multiple test files
- Graceful Ctrl+C handling with cleanup

### 🎯 CRITICAL: Component ID-Based Selectors (TDD Requirement)

**RULE:** Always use element IDs for Playwright selectors. Text-based selectors are FRAGILE and PROHIBITED.

**WHY:**
- ✅ 10x faster (getElementById vs DOM text search)
- ✅ Immune to text changes (i18n, wording updates, HTML restructuring)
- ✅ Explicit intent (`#login-btn` is clearer than `button:has-text("Login")`)
- ✅ No false positives (unique ID vs multiple matching texts)

**WRONG (FRAGILE - DO NOT USE):**
```typescript
// ❌ BREAKS when text changes, slow DOM search, ambiguous
const button = page.locator('button:has-text("Start Session")').first();
const link = page.locator('div:has-text("Transcript Canvas")');
```

**CORRECT (ROBUST - ALWAYS USE):**
```typescript
// ✅ Fast, reliable, explicit, future-proof
const button = page.locator('#sidebar-start-session-btn');
const link = page.locator('#reg-transcript-canvas-btn');
```

**Component ID Discovery:**
Before writing ANY Playwright test, discover available IDs:
1. Open target component file (e.g., `HostControlPanelSidebar.razor`)
2. Search for `id="` attributes
3. Use those IDs in your test selectors
4. If no ID exists → ADD ONE to the component (with `[REFACTOR:component-id]` comment)

**Enforcement:**
- Test reviews MUST reject text-based selectors
- CORTEX test-generator SHOULD warn when ID exists but text selector used
- Future: Automated crawler will build `KDS/cache/component-ids.json`

### Application Routes & Tokens

**Host Control Panel:**
- Route: `https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/{hostToken}`
- Page File: `SPA/NoorCanvas/Pages/HostControlPanel.razor`
- Component File: `SPA/NoorCanvas/Components/Host/HostControlPanelContent.razor`
- Session 212 Token: `PQ9N5YWW`
- Full URL: `https://localhost:9091/host/control-panel/PQ9N5YWW`

**Component IDs (Host Control Panel):**
| Element | Component | ID | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|-----|---------|
| Transcript Canvas Button | UserRegistrationLink.razor | `reg-transcript-canvas-btn` | Select transcript canvas mode |
| Asset Canvas Button | UserRegistrationLink.razor | `reg-asset-canvas-btn` | Select asset canvas mode |
| Start Session Button | HostControlPanelSidebar.razor | `sidebar-start-session-btn` | Initiate session |
| Registration Link Container | UserRegistrationLink.razor | `reg-link-container` | Parent container for canvas buttons |

### Standard Protocol Pattern

**Reference Implementation:** `Scripts/run-debug-panel-percy-tests.ps1`

**Required Steps:**
1. ✅ Launch app using `Start-Job` with `dotnet run` (NOT Start-Process)
2. ✅ Wait for app readiness (20 seconds minimum, or health check loop)
3. ✅ Run Playwright tests using `npx playwright test [file] --headed`
4. ✅ Cleanup with `Stop-Job` and `Remove-Job` (unless -KeepAppRunning)

### Correct Pattern (FOLLOW THIS)

```powershell
param([switch]$KeepAppRunning)

# Step 1: Start app with Start-Job
$appJob = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
    Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas'
    dotnet run
}

# Step 2: Wait for readiness (20s minimum)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 20

# Step 3: Run Playwright tests
try {
    Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS'
    npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
    $exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
}
finally {
    # Step 4: Cleanup
    if (-not $KeepAppRunning) {
        Stop-Job -Job $appJob -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
        Remove-Job -Job $appJob -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    }
}

exit $exitCode
```

### WRONG Patterns (NEVER DO THIS)

❌ **Using Start-Process with -ArgumentList:**
```powershell
# WRONG - Don't use Start-Process with complex arguments
$proc = Start-Process -FilePath "npx" -ArgumentList $testArgs -NoNewWindow -Wait -PassThru
```

❌ **Using Invoke-WebRequest for health checks without proper error handling:**
```powershell
# WRONG - Complex health check that can fail unpredictably
$resp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $appUrl -SkipCertificateCheck -TimeoutSec 5
```

❌ **Separating test running from working directory:**
```powershell
# WRONG - Don't Push-Location multiple times
Push-Location $testsPath
npx playwright test
Pop-Location
```

### Playwright Command Format

**Correct:**
```powershell
# Set working directory ONCE, then run test
Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS'
npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
```

**For Percy visual tests:**
```powershell
# Percy wraps Playwright
percy exec -- playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
```

**Capture exit code:**
```powershell
npx playwright test Tests/UI/my-test.spec.ts --headed
$exitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
exit $exitCode
```

### Test Script Checklist

Before creating ANY Playwright test automation script, verify:

```
✓ Uses Start-Job (not Start-Process) for app launch?
✓ Waits minimum 20 seconds for app readiness?
✓ Sets working directory to project root (not Tests/UI)?
✓ Runs npx playwright test with direct command (no Start-Process)?
✓ Captures $LASTEXITCODE for exit status?
✓ Cleans up with Stop-Job and Remove-Job?
✓ Supports -KeepAppRunning parameter?

If ANY answer is NO → FIX before running
```

### Reference Scripts

**Study these working examples:**
- ✅ `Scripts/run-debug-panel-percy-tests.ps1` - Full featured (health checks, Percy, detailed logging)
- ✅ `Scripts/run-transcript-canvas-visual-tests.ps1` - Simple pattern (20s wait, basic cleanup)
- ✅ `Scripts/run-fab-share-button-percy-tests.ps1` - Percy visual regression pattern

**Key Patterns:**
```powershell
# App Launch
$appJob = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {
    Set-Location 'D:\PROJECTS\NOOR CANVAS\SPA\NoorCanvas'
    dotnet run
}

# Wait Pattern (Simple)
Start-Sleep -Seconds 20

# Wait Pattern (Health Check - Advanced)
while ($attempt -lt $maxAttempts) {
    try {
        $resp = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $appUrl -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 5
        if ($resp.StatusCode -eq 200) { break }
    } catch {
        Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
    }

## 🏗️ Architectural Thinking Mandate

**CRITICAL RULE: All CORTEX agents MUST think architecturally when proposing solutions.**

### Core Principles

**1. Architecture-First Design**
- ✅ Understand existing application architecture BEFORE proposing solutions
- ✅ Design solutions that naturally fit the current architecture from the start
- ❌ NEVER propose monolithic implementations that need refactoring later
- ❌ NEVER create "everything in one file" with intent to break apart later

**2. Pre-Flight Architectural Validation**
Every solution proposal must pass this refactor logic check:

```
BEFORE proposing a solution:
  ↓
1. Identify current architectural patterns
   - Component structure (where do similar components live?)
   - API organization (where do similar APIs exist?)
   - Service layer patterns (how are services currently structured?)
   - State management (what patterns are in use?)
   - File organization (what's the project structure?)
   ↓
2. Run mental refactor test
   - Would this solution require significant refactoring to fit the architecture?
   - Am I creating files that don't match existing conventions?
   - Am I mixing concerns that are separated elsewhere?
   ↓
3. If refactor is needed → REDESIGN the solution
   - Align with existing patterns
   - Follow established separation of concerns
   - Place files in correct locations from the start
   ↓
4. Only then propose the architecturally-aligned solution
```

**3. Forbidden Anti-Patterns**

❌ **NEVER do this:**
```
❌ "Let's create everything in PageComponent.razor first, then we'll break out 
   the child components later"
   
❌ "I'll add the API logic to the page for now, we can move it to a service later"

❌ "Let's put this in a temporary location and reorganize after it works"

❌ "We'll create the monolith first, then refactor to match your architecture"
```

✅ **ALWAYS do this:**
```
✅ "Based on the existing component structure in Components/Canvas/, 
   I'll create CanvasPdfExport.razor there and import it into the parent"
   
✅ "Following the pattern in Services/, I'll create PdfExportService.cs 
   and inject it via DI as seen in other services"

✅ "The existing API controllers are in Controllers/API/, so I'll create 
   PdfExportController.cs there with the same routing pattern"

✅ "This matches the architecture - components are separated, services handle 
   business logic, and APIs are in the correct location from the start"
```

**4. Architectural Discovery Process**

Before proposing ANY solution, agents must:

```
Step 1: Discover Current Architecture
  - Search for similar features/components
  - Identify existing patterns and conventions
  - Map out file organization structure
  - Understand separation of concerns

Step 2: Pattern Matching
  - "Where do similar components live?"
  - "How are APIs currently organized?"
  - "What's the service layer pattern?"
  - "How is state managed?"

Step 3: Alignment Check
  - Does my solution follow these patterns?
  - Are files in the right locations?
  - Is separation of concerns maintained?
  - Would a developer familiar with this codebase find this natural?

Step 4: Propose Solution
  - Only after architectural alignment is confirmed
  - Explicitly state which patterns you're following
  - Show how it fits the existing structure
```

**5. Implementation Example**

**BAD (Anti-Pattern):**
```markdown
Plan: Add PDF export feature

Phase 1: Create basic implementation
  - Task 1.1: Add export logic to TranscriptCanvas.razor
  - Task 1.2: Test the functionality
  
Phase 2: Refactor to proper architecture
  - Task 2.1: Extract to PdfExportService
  - Task 2.2: Create dedicated component
  - Task 2.3: Move to API controller

❌ This violates architectural thinking - refactoring is built into the plan!
```

**GOOD (Architecturally Aligned):**
```markdown
Plan: Add PDF export feature

Phase 0: Architectural Discovery
  - Task 0.1: Map existing service patterns (Services/)
  - Task 0.2: Identify component organization (Components/)
  - Task 0.3: Review API structure (Controllers/API/)

Phase 1: Test Infrastructure (following existing test patterns)
  - Task 1.1: Create PdfExportServiceTests.cs (Tests/Unit/Services/)
  - Task 1.2: Create PdfExportController tests (Tests/Unit/Controllers/)
  - Task 1.3: Create visual tests (Tests/UI/pdf-export.spec.ts)

Phase 2: Implementation (architecturally aligned from start)
  - Task 2.1: Create PdfExportService.cs in Services/
  - Task 2.2: Create PdfExportButton.razor in Components/Canvas/
  - Task 2.3: Create PdfExportController.cs in Controllers/API/
  - Task 2.4: Register service in DI (Program.cs pattern)

✅ This is architecturally correct from the start - no refactoring needed!
```

**6. Agent-Specific Requirements**

**Work Planner (work-planner.md):**
- ✅ MUST include "Phase 0: Architectural Discovery" for new features
- ✅ Plans must show architectural alignment in task descriptions
- ✅ File paths must match existing conventions

**Code Executor (code-executor.md):**
- ✅ MUST verify file location matches architecture before creating
- ✅ MUST follow existing patterns for similar features
- ✅ MUST NOT create temporary/placeholder implementations

**Test Generator (test-generator.md):**
- ✅ Tests must mirror the application's architectural organization
- ✅ Test files must be placed following existing test structure

**7. Validation Checkpoint**

Before ANY code generation, agents must answer:

```
✓ Have I identified where similar code lives in this architecture?
✓ Am I following the existing file organization patterns?
✓ Is my separation of concerns consistent with the codebase?
✓ Would this solution require refactoring to fit the architecture?
✓ Am I creating files in their permanent, correct locations?

If ANY answer is NO → STOP and redesign the solution
```

**8. Success Criteria**

A solution is architecturally valid when:
- ✅ No refactoring phase exists in the plan
- ✅ Files are in correct locations from creation
- ✅ Patterns match existing similar features
- ✅ Separation of concerns is maintained from start
- ✅ A developer familiar with the codebase would say "this fits naturally"

### Commit Changes (Automatic After Task Completion)
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md

Commit changes
```
→ Uses: **KDS/scripts/commit-kds-changes.ps1** → Smart commit handler achieving zero uncommitted files

**⚠️ NOTE: Commits happen AUTOMATICALLY after each task completion (Rule #16)**

You typically don't need to invoke this manually. CORTEX automatically commits after:
- ✅ Every task completes successfully
- ✅ All tests pass (GREEN)
- ✅ Post-implementation review passes
- ✅ Build validates with zero errors

**Manual use cases (when commits were skipped or failed):**
- 🔄 Re-running commit after fixing validation issues
- 📝 Committing documentation-only changes
- 🧹 Committing cleanup/reorganization work

**What automatic commits do:**
- ✅ Analyzes uncommitted files and categorizes them intelligently
- ✅ Auto-updates .gitignore for CORTEX auto-generated files (BRAIN state, internal prompts, reports)
- ✅ Resets auto-generated files that should not be committed (conversation-context.jsonl, etc.)
- ✅ Stages only user-created files (user prompts, documentation, code)
- ✅ Creates semantic commit messages (feat/fix/docs/chore)
- ✅ Achieves zero uncommitted files automatically
- ✅ Interactive mode for documentation decisions
- ✅ Dry-run mode for preview without changes

**Automatic .gitignore management:**
- CORTEX BRAIN state files (conversation-context.jsonl, conversation-history.jsonl, development-context.yaml)
- CORTEX internal prompts (auto-updated by system)
- CORTEX reports (monitoring/, self-review/, test-reports/)
- PlayWright CORTEX artifacts
- Temporary test files (.mjs, .spec.*)

### Reset BRAIN for New Application (Amnesia)
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md

Reset BRAIN for new application
```
→ Routes to: **brain-amnesia.md** → Safely removes application-specific data

Or run directly:
```powershell
.\KDS\scripts\brain-amnesia.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates backup of current BRAIN state
- ✅ Generates amnesia report (shows what will be removed vs preserved)
- ✅ Removes application-specific data (file paths, workflows, conversations)
- ✅ Preserves CORTEX core intelligence (generic patterns, governance)
- ✅ Resets BRAIN to fresh state ready for new project

**⚠️ CRITICAL: What Gets Removed (Application-Specific)**
```yaml
WILL BE REMOVED:
  - All file relationships (e.g., SPA/NoorCanvas paths)
  - Application-specific workflows (e.g., blazor_component_api_flow)
  - All conversations (application context)
  - All events (application interactions)
  - Development metrics (git stats, velocity)
  - Feature components (e.g., fab_button)
```

**✅ GUARANTEED: What Gets Preserved (CORTEX Intelligence)**
```yaml
WILL BE PRESERVED:
  - Generic intent patterns ("add [X] button" → plan)
  - Generic workflow patterns (test_first_id_preparation)
  - KDS-specific patterns (kds_health_monitoring, brain_test_synchronization)
  - Protection configuration (confidence thresholds)
  - All 10 specialist agents
  - All governance rules
  - All CORTEX prompts and scripts
```

**Use Cases:**
- 🔄 Moving CORTEX to a completely new project
- 🆕 Starting fresh with a different application
- 🧹 Cleaning BRAIN after experimenting with test project
- 📦 Preparing CORTEX for distribution to new team/project

**Safety:**
- ✅ Backup created before any changes
- ✅ Dry-run mode available (`-DryRun` parameter)
- ✅ Requires confirmation (type 'AMNESIA' to proceed)
- ✅ Full rollback possible from backup
- ✅ BRAIN integrity verified after amnesia

**Example Output:**
```

Next Steps:
  1. Update KDS/tooling/cortex.config.json (new project name/paths)
  2. Run: #file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md Setup
  3. CORTEX will learn your new application architecture
```

**Post-Amnesia Workflow:**
1. ✅ Amnesia complete (BRAIN reset)
2. Update `cortex.config.json` with new project details
3. Run `Setup` command to discover new application
4. CORTEX automatically learns from new interactions
5. BRAIN rebuilds application-specific knowledge over time

**Rollback (if needed):**
```powershell
# Restore from backup
$backupDir = "KDS/cortex-brain/backups/pre-amnesia-{timestamp}"
Copy-Item -Path "$backupDir/*.yaml" -Destination "KDS/cortex-brain/" -Force
Copy-Item -Path "$backupDir/*.jsonl" -Destination "KDS/cortex-brain/" -Force
```

## 🧠 CORTEX Health Dashboard

**Purpose:** Visual monitoring dashboard for CORTEX system health, BRAIN status, and development metrics.

### Launch Dashboard

```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md launch dashboard
```

Or directly:
```powershell
.\KDS\scripts\launch-dashboard.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Starts API server in a **separate visible PowerShell window**
- ✅ Opens dashboard in your default browser
- ✅ Provides real-time health monitoring
- ✅ Shows visual feedback for all operations

**⚠️ PERMANENT RULE: API Server Window Behavior**

The API server MUST run in a **separate visible PowerShell window**, NOT as a background job.

**Rationale:**
- ✅ User can see server logs in real-time
- ✅ Easy to stop (just close the window or Ctrl+C)
- ✅ Clear visual indicator that server is running
- ✅ No hidden background processes
- ❌ Background jobs are invisible and hard to manage
- ❌ Users couldn't tell if server was running

**Implementation:**
```powershell
# CORRECT - Separate visible window
Start-Process pwsh -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd '$workspaceRoot'; .\KDS\scripts\dashboard-api-server.ps1"

# WRONG - Background job (DO NOT USE)
$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock { ... }
```

### Dashboard Features

**Visual Loading Feedback:**
- 📊 Progress bar at top of page during operations
- 🔄 Loading overlay with detailed status messages
- ⏱️ Real-time progress updates
- 🎯 Stats start at 0 and refresh with live data

**Health Check Categories:**
- 🏗️ Infrastructure (files, directories, permissions)
- 🤖 Agents & Prompts (all 10 specialist agents)
- 🧠 BRAIN System (3-tier architecture)
- 💾 Session State (active sessions, history)
- 📚 Knowledge Base (graph, patterns, context)
- 🔧 Scripts & Tools (PowerShell, validation)
- ⚡ Performance (response times, efficiency)

**Actions:**
- 🔄 **Refresh** - Run all health checks (shows loading feedback)
- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard** - Copy health report JSON (with fallback for file:// protocol)
- 📊 **Export Report** - Download JSON file

**Connection States:**
- 🔗 **Live** - API server connected, real data
- 🔌 **Disconnected** - API server not running (shows retry button)

### Copy to Clipboard Feature

**Multi-Layer Fallback System:**

1. **Modern Clipboard API** (HTTPS/secure context)
   ```javascript
   navigator.clipboard.writeText(jsonText)
   ```

2. **Legacy execCommand** (HTTP/file:// protocol)
   ```javascript
   document.execCommand('copy')
   ```

3. **Manual Prompt** (Last resort)
   ```javascript
   prompt('Copy this JSON (Ctrl+C):', jsonText)
   ```

**Why fallback is needed:**
- ⚠️ Dashboard runs on `file://` protocol (not HTTPS)
- ⚠️ Modern clipboard API requires secure context
- ✅ Fallback ensures copy works in all scenarios
- ✅ Always provides a way to get the JSON

### To Stop Dashboard

**Option 1:** Close the API server PowerShell window

**Option 2:** Press Ctrl+C in the API server window

**Option 3:** Just close your browser (server keeps running until manually stopped)

**Dashboard remains functional** in disconnected mode - you can view cached data and retry connection.

## 🚀 First-Time Setup (New Application Installation)

**When to use this:** You're installing CORTEX in a new application (e.g., a fresh project like `https://github.com/yourname/new-project`)

**Purpose:** Complete CORTEX initialization with brain absorption, crawlers, and knowledge graph population for application-specific intelligence.

### Setup Command

```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md Setup
```

This triggers the complete CORTEX initialization sequence.

**⏱️ Expected Duration: 15-20 minutes** (padded estimate)
- Small project (<1000 files): ~10-12 minutes
- Medium project (1000-5000 files): ~15-18 minutes  
- Large project (>5000 files): ~20-25 minutes

**🔔 Status Updates:** You'll receive progress updates every 30-60 seconds so you know the system is working.

---

### 📋 Setup Sequence (Automatic)

When you invoke `Setup`, CORTEX executes this sequence:

**⚙️ RULE: Long-Running Process Protocol**

ALL long-running operations (>30 seconds) in CORTEX MUST:
1. ✅ Display padded time estimate upfront (add 25-50% buffer)
2. ✅ Show phase-by-phase progress indicators
3. ✅ Provide status updates every 30-60 seconds
4. ✅ Display percentage complete when measurable
5. ✅ Show "Still working..." heartbeat for CPU-intensive tasks
6. ✅ Explain what's happening (not just "Processing...")
7. ✅ Allow graceful interruption (Ctrl+C with cleanup)

**Examples of long-running operations:**
- Setup sequence (15-20 min)
- Deep crawler (5-10 min)
- Development context collection (2-5 min)
- BRAIN updates with large event backlogs (1-3 min)
- Test suite runs (varies)
- Build processes (varies)

**See:** Full protocol at end of this section

**Step 2.1: Create BRAIN Storage**
```
⏳ Creating BRAIN directory structure...

✓ Initialize KDS/cortex-brain/ directory structure
  - conversation-history.jsonl (Tier 1 - empty initially)
  - knowledge-graph.yaml (Tier 2 - base template)
  - development-context.yaml (Tier 3 - empty initially)
  - events.jsonl (event stream - empty)
  - crawler-state.yaml (crawler tracking)
✓ Set up session storage (KDS/sessions/)
✓ Create knowledge repository (KDS/knowledge/)

Status: ✅ BRAIN storage created
📊 Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░] 25%
```

**Step 2.2: Run Deep Codebase Crawler**
```
⏳ Starting deep codebase crawl...
⏱️  This will take 5-10 minutes depending on project size

Invoke: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-crawler.md
Mode: deep
Duration: 5-10 minutes

Status updates every 60 seconds:
  [00:30] 📂 Discovered 247 files (still scanning...)
  [01:00] 📂 Discovered 612 files (analyzing structure...)
  [01:30] 📂 Discovered 1,089 files (mapping relationships...)
  [02:00] 🔍 Parsing file contents (324/1,089 files)
  [02:30] 🔍 Parsing file contents (687/1,089 files)
  [03:00] 🔍 Analyzing imports and dependencies...
  [03:30] 📊 Building relationship graph...
  [04:00] 🎯 Detecting naming conventions...
  [04:30] ✅ Crawler complete - generating report...

What it discovers:
✓ File structure & architecture (where components/services/tests live)
✓ Code relationships (dependencies, imports, DI patterns)
✓ Test patterns (frameworks, selectors, test data)
✓ Technology stack (languages, frameworks, libraries)
✓ Naming conventions (PascalCase, kebab-case, etc.)
✓ Configuration patterns (appsettings hierarchy, env vars)
✓ Documentation locations (README files, API docs)
✓ **Database schemas (SQL files FIRST, then connection strings)** 🆕

**Database Discovery Priority (NEW v1.1.0):**
  1️⃣ FIRST: Scan for SQL schema/data files (*schema*.sql, *data*.sql)
     - Analyzes CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO statements
     - Extracts table names, relationships
     - Brain can reference these files (no database connection needed!)
  
  2️⃣ SECOND: Look for connection strings (appsettings.json, .env)
     - Discovers database provider (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.)
     - Finds Entity Framework models and migrations
  
  3️⃣ THIRD: Connect to database (only if no SQL files found)
     - Prompts for connection string if not found
     - Memorizes it for future use (KDS/cortex-brain/database-connection.txt)
     - Crawls live schema (tables, columns)
  
  ⚡ Result: 10x faster when SQL files exist! (~30s vs 2-5 min)
  
  See: `KDS/docs/features/database-crawler-sql-file-priority.md` for details

Feeds BRAIN with:
  - architectural_patterns (Components/**/*.razor)
  - file_relationships (co-modification patterns)
  - test_patterns (Playwright, session-212, data-testid)
  - conventions (naming, file organization)
  - technology_stack (complete inventory)

Status: ✅ Crawler discovered 1,089 files, 3,247 relationships
📊 Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░] 35%
```

**Output:** Crawler report (`KDS/cortex-brain/crawler-report-{timestamp}.md`)

**Step 2.3: Initialize Development Context (Tier 3)**

### 📊 Long-Running Process Protocol (UNIVERSAL RULE)

**APPLIES TO:** All CORTEX operations >30 seconds

**Required Elements:**

1. **Upfront Expectation Setting**
   ```
   ⏱️  Estimated time: X-Y minutes (padded 25-50%)
   ⚠️  This is the longest phase - please be patient!
   ```

2. **Visual Progress Indicators**
   ```
   📊 Progress: [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░] 45%
   🔄 Phase 3/6: Knowledge Graph Population
   ```

   Every 30-60 seconds:
   [00:30] Still working on X... (detail what's happening)
   [01:00] Processing Y... (show counts/progress)
   [01:30] Almost done with Z... (reassure user)
   ```

4. **Informative Messages**
   ```
   ❌ BAD: "Processing..." (vague, scary)
   ✅ GOOD: "Analyzing 1,247 commits for velocity patterns..."
   
   ❌ BAD: "Please wait..." (no context)
   ✅ GOOD: "Scanning 612 files for architectural patterns (2m 30s elapsed)"
   ```

   ⚠️  Cleanup will run automatically if interrupted
   ```

7. **Error Recovery Guidance**
   ```
   If something goes wrong:
   ❌ Error at Phase 3 (2m 15s elapsed)
   💡 You can:
      1. Retry this phase only
      2. Skip and continue (if non-critical)
      3. Cancel and review logs
   ```

**Implementation Checklist:**

For ALL long-running operations, verify:
- ☐ Padded time estimate shown upfront (realistic + buffer)
- ☐ Phase/step breakdown displayed
- ☐ Progress bar or percentage shown
- ☐ Status updates every 30-60 seconds minimum
- ☐ Detailed "what's happening now" messages
- ☐ Elapsed time counter visible
- ☐ Graceful Ctrl+C handling
- ☐ Clear completion confirmation
- ☐ Error messages with recovery options

**Examples in KDS:**

```markdown
Long-Running Operations:
✓ Setup (15-20 min) - Has all required elements above
✓ Deep Crawler (5-10 min) - Needs status updates added
✓ Development Context Collection (2-5 min) - Needs progress bar
✓ BRAIN Update with backlog (1-3 min) - Needs heartbeat
✓ Test Suite Execution (varies) - Needs all elements
✓ Build Processes (varies) - Needs all elements
```

**Agents Responsible:**

All specialist agents that trigger long operations:
- `work-planner.md` - When creating large plans
- `code-executor.md` - When running builds/tests
- `test-generator.md` - When generating many tests
- `health-validator.md` - When running full validation
- `brain-crawler.md` - When scanning codebase
- `development-context-collector.md` - When analyzing history
- `brain-updater.md` - When processing large backlogs

**PowerShell Script Requirements:**

All CORTEX scripts (`.ps1`) MUST include:
```powershell
# At start
Write-Host "⏱️  Estimated time: 3-5 minutes" -ForegroundColor Yellow
$stopwatch = [System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch]::StartNew()

# During execution (every 30-60s)
Write-Host "[$(($stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds).ToString('00.0'))s] Still working on X..." -ForegroundColor Cyan

# At completion
$stopwatch.Stop()
Write-Host "✅ Complete in $($stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalMinutes.ToString('0.0'))m" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**See Also:**
- Playwright Testing Protocol (uses 20s wait with status)
- Health Validator (should show check-by-check progress)
- Crawler modes (quick vs deep time estimates)

---

### 🎯 Setup Modes

**Default Mode: Full Setup (Recommended)**
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md Setup
```
- ⏱️ Duration: 15-20 minutes (padded estimate)
- Runs all 6 phases with complete initialization
- Complete BRAIN initialization with deep crawler
- Ready for immediate production use
- **Status updates:** Every 30-60 seconds
- **Progress tracking:** Phase-by-phase with percentage

**Quick Mode: Minimal Setup (For Testing)**
```markdown

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Setup

**Setup fails at Phase 1 (Validation):**
```
Cause: Missing CORTEX files or permissions issue
Fix: 
  1. Verify KDS/ directory copied completely
  2. Check file permissions (should be readable/writable)
  3. Ensure Git is installed and accessible
```

**Setup fails at Phase 2 (Crawler):**
```
Cause: Large codebase (>10,000 files) or binary files
Fix:
  1. Use Setup --quick (skips deep scan)
  2. Manually run targeted crawler later
  3. Add skip patterns to KDS/cortex-brain/crawler-config.yaml
```

**Setup succeeds but queries fail:**
```
Cause: Knowledge graph structure invalid
Fix:
  1. Check KDS/cortex-brain/knowledge-graph.yaml syntax
  2. Re-run: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
  3. Validate with: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/health-validator.md
```

---

### ✅ Setup Success Indicators

You'll know setup succeeded when:

```
✓ All 6 phases completed without errors
✓ KDS/setup-report-{timestamp}.md exists
✓ knowledge-graph.yaml has 50+ entries
✓ development-context.yaml has baseline metrics
✓ Health validator reports "All checks passed"
✓ Test query returns architectural patterns
✓ First cortex.md request routes correctly
```

---

### 🎓 Post-Setup Best Practices

**1. Verify BRAIN Learning:**
```
After your first few CORTEX interactions:

Check: KDS/cortex-brain/events.jsonl (should have new events)
Check: conversation-history.jsonl (should have conversations)
Run: #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md (manual update)
Verify: knowledge-graph.yaml updated with your patterns
```

**2. Regular Maintenance:**
```
Daily: Let automatic learning work (no action needed)
Weekly: Check proactive_warnings in development-context.yaml
Monthly: Run incremental crawler (keep structure current)
After refactoring: Run deep crawler (re-learn architecture)
```

**3. Optimize for Your Workflow:**
```
If CORTEX misroutes frequently:
  → Check intent_patterns in knowledge-graph.yaml
  → Add manual entries for your common phrases
  
If file suggestions wrong:
  → Check architectural_patterns
  → Run targeted crawler on new modules
  
If estimates inaccurate:
  → Let development-context accumulate data (2-4 weeks)
  → Correlations improve with more history
```

## 🤖 How It Works

### Step 1: Intent Detection
When you use `cortex.md`, it loads the **Intent Router** agent which analyzes your request.

**Router reads:**
```yaml
keywords:
  plan: ["I want to", "add a", "create a", "build a", "implement"]
  execute: ["continue", "next task", "keep going", "proceed"]
  resume: ["where was I", "show progress", "left off", "resume"]
  correct: ["wrong file", "not what I", "actually", "correction"]
  test: ["test", "visual regression", "playwright", "unit test"]
  validate: ["health", "validate", "check", "run all", "status"]
  ask: ["how do I", "what is", "explain", "tell me about"]
  govern: ["I updated KDS", "I modified KDS", "review my changes"]
```

### Step 2: Routing Decision
```
User: "I want to add dark mode"
  ↓
Intent Router: Detects "I want to add" = PLAN intent
  ↓
Routes to: plan.md → work-planner.md
  ↓
Creates multi-phase plan, saves session state
```

### Step 3: Execution
The appropriate specialist agent executes:
- **Planner:** Breaks work into phases/tasks
- **Executor:** Implements code changes
- **Tester:** Creates and runs tests
- **Validator:** Checks system health
- **Governor:** Reviews CORTEX modifications
- **Knowledge Retriever:** Answers questions

### Step 4: Handoff (If Multi-Step)
For complex requests like "Add dark mode and test it":
```
User: "I want to add dark mode and test it"
  ↓
Intent Router: Detects TWO intents (PLAN + TEST)
  ↓
Routes to: plan.md → work-planner.md
  ↓
Planner creates plan with testing phase
  ↓
Tells you: "Next: #file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md continue"
  ↓
You: "continue"
  ↓
Routes to: execute.md → code-executor.md
  ↓
Implements code → Routes to: test.md → test-generator.md
  ↓
Creates tests → Validates → Complete
```

## 🎯 Intent Detection Rules

**LOAD:** `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/intent-router.md`

The router uses these patterns:

### PRIMARY INTENT (Choose One)

**PLAN** - Starting new feature work
```
Patterns: "I want to", "add a", "create a", "build", "implement"
Examples: 
  - "I want to add a share button"
  - "Create a PDF export feature"
  - "Build a dark mode toggle"
```

**EXECUTE** - Continue active session
```
Patterns: "continue", "next", "keep going", "proceed", "execute"
Examples:
  - "Continue working"
  - "Next task"
  - "Keep going"
```

**RESUME** - Pickup after interruption
```
Patterns: "resume", "where was I", "show progress", "left off", "status"
Examples:
  - "Show me where I left off"
  - "What's the current status?"
  - "Resume work"
```

**CORRECT** - Fix Copilot error
```
Patterns: "wrong", "not that", "actually", "correction", "fix"
Examples:
  - "You're working on the wrong file"
  - "That's not what I meant"
  - "Actually, use SignalR not polling"
```

**TEST** - Create or run tests
```
Patterns: "test", "playwright", "visual regression", "unit test"
Examples:
  - "Create visual tests for the button"
  - "Run all Playwright tests"
  - "Add unit tests for the service"
```

**VALIDATE** - System health check
```
Patterns: "validate", "health", "check", "run all", "quality"
Examples:
  - "Check system health"
  - "Validate all changes"
  - "Run quality checks"
```

**ASK** - Question about KDS/codebase
```
Patterns: "how do I", "what is", "explain", "tell me", "?"
Examples:
  - "How do I test canvas elements?"
  - "What test patterns exist?"
  - "Explain the session state"
```

**GOVERN** - Review CORTEX changes
```
Patterns: "I updated KDS", "modified KDS", "review", "CORTEX change"
Examples:
  - "I updated the test-generator"
  - "Review my CORTEX modifications"
  - "I changed the rules"
```

### 🧠 Proactive Warnings (NEW - Post-Week 4 Enhancement)

**Before routing, CORTEX BRAIN analyzes your request and shows warnings:**

**When warnings appear:**
- ✅ PLAN intent detected (starting new feature)
- ✅ EXECUTE intent detected (continuing work)

**What gets predicted:**
```yaml
🟡 File Hotspot Warnings:
   "⚠️ HostControlPanel.razor is a hotspot (28% churn)"
   → Suggests: Add extra validation

🟡 Complexity Warnings:
   "⚠️ PDF features take 50% longer than other exports"
   → Suggests: Allocate more time

🟡 Velocity Warnings:
   "⚠️ Velocity dropped 30% this week"
   → Suggests: Smaller commits

🟢 Success Patterns:
   "✅ Test-first has 96% success rate for exports"
   → Suggests: Continue TDD workflow
```

**Example:**
```markdown
User: #file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md
      I want to add PDF export

🧠 BRAIN Analysis:
────────────────────────────────────────────────
🟡 ⚠️ HostControlPanel.razor is a hotspot (28% churn)
   💡 Add extra validation phase
   
🟢 ✅ Test-first approach has 96% success rate
   💡 Continue TDD workflow
────────────────────────────────────────────────

Routing to work-planner.md...
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ **Instant feedback** - Warnings appear in <5 seconds (before planning)
- 🎯 **Better decisions** - Adjust approach before creating plan
- 📊 **Data-driven** - Predictions based on historical patterns
- 🔄 **Continuous learning** - Accuracy improves over time

**Implementation:** Step 1.3 in `intent-router.md` (between user input and conversation context)

**ANALYZE_SCREENSHOT** - Extract requirements from images
```
Patterns: "analyze screenshot", "extract from image", "what does mockup show", "read annotations"
Examples:
  - "Analyze this screenshot and extract requirements"
  - "What does this mockup show?"
  - "Extract specs from this design"
  - "Read the annotations on this bug report"
  - [Image attachment detected]
```

**COMMIT** - Intelligent git commits
```
Patterns: "commit changes", "commit work", "git commit", "save to git"
Examples:
  - "Commit changes"

## ✅ Benefits of Universal Entry Point + SOLID v5.0

### User Experience
- ✅ **One command to remember** (`cortex.md`)
- ✅ **Natural language** - say what you want
- ✅ **No cognitive load** - don't need to know which specialist to call
- ✅ **Forgiving** - works even if you're vague
- ✅ **Predictable** - same command, consistent behavior

### Technical Benefits (SOLID v5.0)
- ✅ **Intelligent routing** - right agent for the job
- ✅ **Multi-intent handling** - complex requests work
- ✅ **Context preservation** - session state via abstraction
- ✅ **Automatic workflows** - no manual orchestration
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - each agent focused on one job
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion** - swap storage/tools without breaking agents
- ✅ **Interface Segregation** - no mode switches, dedicated specialists
- ✅ **Easy to test** - mock abstractions, isolate agents

### Architecture Benefits
- 🎯 **Modular** - add new agents without touching existing ones
- 🔧 **Maintainable** - fix bugs in one place
- 🚀 **Performant** - no mode-switch overhead
- 📦 **Portable** - abstractions make storage/tools swappable
- 🏠 **Local-First** - 100% in KDS/, zero external dependencies
- 🔒 **Offline-Capable** - works without internet (except optional cloud features)
- 🆓 **Zero-Install** - no npm/pip/dotnet packages required for KDS

### Comparison

**Before v5.0 (7 commands + mode switches):**
```
plan.md → for new features
execute.md → for continuing work + corrections (mode switch)
resume.md → after breaks (actually loads work-planner)
correct.md → for fixing errors (loads executor in correction mode)
test.md → for creating tests
validate.md → for health checks
ask-cortex.md → for questions
govern.md → for CORTEX changes

Issues:
❌ Executor does 2 jobs (execution + correction)
❌ Planner does 2 jobs (planning + resumption)
❌ Hardcoded file paths everywhere
❌ Hardcoded test commands
```

**After v5.0 (1 command + SOLID compliance):**
```
cortex.md → for EVERYTHING
  ↓
intent-router.md → routes to 8 focused specialists
  ↓
Specialists use shared abstractions (session-loader, test-runner, file-accessor)

Benefits:
✅ Each agent has ONE responsibility
✅ Error correction is dedicated (error-corrector.md)
✅ Session resumption is dedicated (session-resumer.md)
✅ Abstractions decouple from storage/tools
✅ Easy to extend (add new agent = add new route)
```

## 🚫 When Routing Fails

**If intent is ambiguous:**
```
You: #file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md
     do something

Router: ❓ Intent unclear. Did you mean:
        1. Continue current work? (execute)
        2. Check progress? (resume)
        3. Validate changes? (validate)
        
        Please clarify.
```

**If no active session and you say "continue":**
```
You: #file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md
     continue

Router: ❌ No active session found.
        Did you mean to start new work?
        Use: "I want to [describe feature]"
```

## 📊 SOLID v5.0 Design Benefits

### Answer: YES - It Makes CORTEX Better!

**Design Improvements:**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - Each agent has ONE clear job
- ✅ **Interface Segregation** - No mode switches (dedicated agents)
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion** - Abstractions decouple from concrete implementations
- ✅ **Open/Closed** - Easy to extend (add agents) without modifying existing code

**SOLID v5.0 Architecture:**
```
User Interface Layer:
  cortex.md (universal) ────────┐
  plan.md (direct)   ────────┤
  execute.md (direct) ───────┤
  test.md (direct)    ───────┤  All route through
  correct.md (direct) ───────┤
  resume.md (direct)  ───────┤
  ...                        ├─→ intent-router.md (ROUTER)
                             │
Internal Agent Layer:        │
  work-planner.md     ←──────┤  (PLAN only)

Abstraction Layer (DIP):
  session-loader.md   → Abstract session access
  test-runner.md      → Abstract test execution
  file-accessor.md    → Abstract file I/O
```

**What Changed from v4.5:**
```diff
- code-executor.md (execution + correction modes) ❌ SRP violation
+ code-executor.md (execution only) ✅ SRP compliant
+ error-corrector.md (correction only) ✅ ISP compliant

- work-planner.md (planning + resumption modes) ❌ SRP violation
+ work-planner.md (planning only) ✅ SRP compliant
+ session-resumer.md (resumption only) ✅ ISP compliant

- Direct file access (#file:KDS/sessions/...) ❌ DIP violation
+ Abstract access (session-loader.md) ✅ DIP compliant

- Hardcoded test commands (npx playwright test) ❌ DIP violation
+ Abstract runner (test-runner.md) ✅ DIP compliant
```

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 **Clarity** - One agent = one job (easier to understand)
- 🚀 **Performance** - No mode-switch logic (faster routing)
- 🔧 **Testability** - Mock abstractions (easier to test)
- 📦 **Flexibility** - Swap storage/tools without breaking agents

**Flexibility:**
```
Option 1 (Easy): Use cortex.md universal entry point
Option 2 (Explicit): Call specific prompts directly
Option 3 (Advanced): Call internal agents with abstractions

All work! Universal is for convenience, SOLID is for quality.
```

## 🧠 BRAIN System Best Practices

### Automatic Learning is ENABLED by Default

**CORTEX v5.0+ automatically logs events and updates BRAIN - no user action needed!**

**What happens automatically:**
1. ✅ Agents log events after every action (routing, file modifications, corrections)
2. ✅ Events accumulate in `KDS/cortex-brain/events.jsonl`
3. ✅ Rule #16 Step 5 checks event count after each task
4. ✅ When 50 events reached → `brain-updater.md` auto-triggered
5. ✅ Knowledge graph updated with new patterns
6. ✅ Next routing decision gets smarter

**You benefit without doing anything!**

### Verify BRAIN is Learning (Optional Health Check)

**Want to confirm automatic learning is working?**

Check these indicators:
```bash
# 1. Recent events logged (should have timestamps from today)
cat KDS/cortex-brain/events.jsonl | tail -5

# 2. Knowledge graph updated recently (check last modified)
ls -la KDS/cortex-brain/knowledge-graph.yaml

# 3. Event count reasonable (not accumulating to 100+)
wc -l KDS/cortex-brain/events.jsonl
```

**Healthy BRAIN signs:**
- ✅ `events.jsonl` has recent timestamps (within last few hours)
- ✅ `knowledge-graph.yaml` updated in last 24 hours
- ✅ Event count stays below 50 (auto-cleanup working)

**⚠️ Warning signs (violations detected):**
- ❌ No events logged for 4+ hours (event logging broken)
- ❌ `knowledge-graph.yaml` not updated in 24+ hours
- ❌ 50+ unprocessed events accumulated (automatic update not triggering)

**If you see warnings:** See `KDS/docs/architecture/KDS-SELF-REVIEW-STRATEGY.md` for fixes

### Manual BRAIN Update (Only if Needed)

**When to manually update:**
- 🔧 After bulk corrections (fixed multiple files at once)
- 🔧 After large refactoring (want BRAIN to learn patterns immediately)
- 🚨 If automatic updates stopped working (>50 events accumulated)
- 📊 Before important routing decision (want latest knowledge)

**How to trigger manually:**
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
```

This processes all events and updates the knowledge graph.

### Standard Practice: Trust Automatic Learning

**Every CORTEX interaction SHOULD automatically:**
1. ✅ Log events (no user action needed)
2. ✅ Query BRAIN for insights (before routing/file decisions)
3. ✅ Update knowledge graph (periodic automatic)

**This is STANDARD CORTEX practice** - all agents follow this pattern automatically.

### For Advanced Users Only

**Manual intervention rarely needed, but available:**

1. **Manually correct routing** if BRAIN suggests wrong intent:
   ```markdown
   #file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md
   Wrong intent! I meant [correct interpretation]
   ```
   Error corrector logs the mistake, BRAIN learns for next time.

2. **Check BRAIN health** during self-review:
   ```markdown
   #file:KDS/prompts/user/validate.md
   Check BRAIN system health
   ```

3. **Force immediate update** after major changes:
   ```markdown
   #file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
   ```

**But in normal usage: Just use CORTEX and let BRAIN learn automatically!**

### First-Time Setup (Optional - BRAIN Works Out of the Box)

**CORTEX v5.0+ works immediately with empty BRAIN - learning starts from first use!**

**Optional bootstrapping (faster initial learning):**

**Option 1: Populate from existing sessions (if you have session history):**
```powershell
# PowerShell - Seed BRAIN from past sessions
.\KDS\scripts\populate-cortex-brain.ps1

# Then update knowledge graph
#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-updater.md
```

**Option 2: Crawl your codebase (recommended for new installations):**
```powershell
# PowerShell - Quick scan (30 seconds)
.\KDS\scripts\brain-crawler.ps1 -Mode quick

# OR Deep scan (5-10 minutes, comprehensive)
.\KDS\scripts\brain-crawler.ps1 -Mode deep
```

The crawler analyzes your entire application and feeds BRAIN with:
- 🏗️ Architectural patterns (where components/services/tests live)
- 🔗 File relationships (what depends on what)
- 📝 Naming conventions (how files are named)
- 🛠️ Technology stack (languages, frameworks, tools)
- 🧪 Test patterns (frameworks, test data, selectors)

**See:** `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-crawler.md` for details

**But remember: Bootstrapping is OPTIONAL - BRAIN learns automatically from first interaction!**

### Ongoing Usage - No Action Needed!

**Just use CORTEX normally!** BRAIN learns automatically from every interaction:
- 📝 Events logged automatically with every agent action
- 🧠 BRAIN updated automatically when 50 events accumulate
- 💡 Decisions get smarter automatically over time
- 🕷️ Optional: Run incremental crawler scans to refresh architectural knowledge

**Zero manual intervention required for continuous learning.**

**Only manual actions needed:**
1. 🚨 If automatic learning breaks (check `KDS-SELF-REVIEW-STRATEGY.md`)
2. 🔧 After bulk corrections (want immediate learning)
3. 📊 When starting new project (run crawler to learn codebase)

**99% of the time: BRAIN just works!**

### Moving CORTEX to Another Application

**Need to reset BRAIN for a new project?**
```powershell
# PowerShell - Soft reset (clear data, keep config)
.\KDS\scripts\brain-reset.ps1 -Mode soft

# OR Export generic patterns first, then reset
.\KDS\scripts\brain-reset.ps1 -Mode export-reset -ExportPath ".\templates\my-patterns\"

# Then crawl the new application
.\KDS\scripts\brain-crawler.ps1 -Mode deep
```

BRAIN gets amnesia (forgets old app) but keeps all logic intact!

**See:** `#file:KDS/prompts/internal/brain-reset.md` for details

### 📋 **PLANNED:** Mind Palace - Advanced Memory Architecture

**Purpose:** Enhanced spatial memory system for complex knowledge organization  
**Priority:** FUTURE  
**Status:** 📋 PLACEHOLDER - Design phase pending

**Concept:**
The Mind Palace extends KDS's BRAIN system with spatial memory techniques for organizing complex technical knowledge. This system will enable Copilot to "mentally navigate" through architectural concepts, code relationships, and project knowledge using memory palace techniques.

**Planned Features:**
- 📋 Spatial knowledge organization (rooms, floors, locations)
- 📋 Visual memory associations for complex patterns
- 📋 Hierarchical knowledge structures
- 📋 Enhanced context retrieval using spatial relationships
- 📋 Integration with existing Tier 2 knowledge graph

**Metric Tracking (Core Requirement):**
The Mind Palace will be designed with comprehensive metric tracking from the start:

```yaml
mind_palace_metrics:
  kds_performance:
    - knowledge_retrieval_speed: "Time to locate relevant patterns"
    - spatial_navigation_accuracy: "Correct room/location hit rate"
    - pattern_association_effectiveness: "Successful pattern matches"
    - memory_consolidation_rate: "Tier 1 → Tier 2 conversion efficiency"
    - context_reconstruction_time: "Resume session speed"
    
  coding_efficiency:
    - time_to_first_code: "Request → First implementation"
    - architectural_alignment_rate: "% of solutions matching existing patterns"
    - rework_reduction: "Before/after Mind Palace implementation"
    - context_switching_overhead: "Time lost when changing tasks"
    - learning_curve_acceleration: "New team member onboarding speed"
    
  quality_metrics:
    - test_coverage_trends: "Before/after Mind Palace"
    - bug_escape_rate: "Issues reaching production"
    - architectural_consistency_score: "Alignment with design patterns"
    - knowledge_retention_rate: "Pattern recall accuracy over time"
    
  roi_measurements:
    - development_velocity_change: "Sprint velocity trends"
    - onboarding_time_reduction: "New developer productivity"
    - context_recovery_savings: "Hours saved on session resumes"
    - decision_quality_improvement: "Architectural decision success rate"
```

**Integration Points:**
- 📋 Tier 2 (Knowledge Graph) - Spatial overlay for existing patterns
- 📋 Tier 3 (Development Context) - Velocity impact tracking
- 📋 Dashboard - Real-time visualization of memory palace structure
- 📋 Metrics Reporter - Dedicated Mind Palace analytics

**Design Phase Tasks:**
1. Research spatial memory techniques for code organization
2. Design memory palace structure (rooms, floors, associations)
3. Define integration with existing BRAIN tiers
4. Create metric collection framework
5. Build prototype with test dataset
6. Validate effectiveness with real-world usage

**Documentation (To Be Created):**
- `docs/architecture/MIND-PALACE-DESIGN.md` - Full specification
- `docs/architecture/MIND-PALACE-METRICS.md` - Measurement framework
- `cortex-brain/mind-palace/` - Storage structure (when implemented)

**Notes:**
- Design will prioritize measurability from day one
- All claims must be backed by quantitative metrics
- Focus on demonstrable coding efficiency improvements
- Integration must be seamless with existing workflows

**When Ready to Design:**
```
#file:KDS/prompts/user/plan.md "Design Mind Palace Memory Architecture with Metrics"
```

## 📋 CORTEX Response Templates - Phase-Based Execution

**Philosophy:** CORTEX creates complete plans upfront but executes **one complete phase at a time**, waiting for approval between phases. This gives users control while avoiding one-task-at-a-time friction.

### ✅ CORRECT: Phase-by-Phase with Approval Gates

**Example 1: Documentation Refresh**
```markdown
## 🚀 Plan Created: Documentation Refresh

I've identified 4 documentation gaps and created a 4-phase plan.

**Complete Plan:**
- Phase 1: Update "The Awakening" story (15 min, 3 tasks)
- Phase 2: Create 26 missing technical docs (45 min, 26 tasks)  
- Phase 3: Generate 8 Mermaid diagrams (20 min, 8 tasks)
- Phase 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages (5 min, 2 tasks)

Total Estimated: 85 minutes

**Start Execution?**
Say **"Yes"** to begin Phase 1 (I'll complete all 3 tasks, then stop for approval).

Say **"Show me Phase 1 details"** to review before starting.
```

**After Phase 1 Completes:**
```markdown
## ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Story Updated

**Delivered:**
- ✅ Updated narrative with 5 new features
- ✅ Added visual diagrams section
- ✅ Refreshed navigation structure

**Validation:**
- ✅ MkDocs build successful
- ✅ All links working
- ✅ Preview verified at localhost:8000

**Next:** Phase 2 - Create 26 technical docs (45 min, 26 tasks)

**Continue?** Say **"Yes"** to proceed with Phase 2, or **"Stop"** to review.
```

**Example 2: Test Failures**
```markdown
## 🔧 3 Test Failures Detected

I've analyzed the failures and created a 3-phase fix plan.

**Complete Plan:**
- Phase 1: Fix async selector in button.spec.ts (1 task)
- Phase 2: Update API mock in service.spec.ts (2 tasks)  
- Phase 3: Add missing import in utils.spec.ts (1 task)

**Note:** Each phase completes fully with validation before moving to next.

**Start Fixes?**
Say **"Yes"** to begin Phase 1 (I'll fix the button test completely, verify it passes, then stop).

Say **"Show root causes"** to review analysis first.
```

**Example 3: Feature Implementation**
```markdown
## ✅ Plan Created: Multi-Language Invoice Export

**4-Phase TDD Implementation:**
- Phase 1: Service layer (tests → code) - 30 min, 6 tasks
- Phase 2: API endpoints (tests → code) - 25 min, 5 tasks  
- Phase 3: UI component (tests → code) - 40 min, 8 tasks
- Phase 4: Integration tests & validation - 20 min, 4 tasks

Total: ~115 minutes | All phases use TDD (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)

**Begin Implementation?**
Say **"Yes"** to start Phase 1 (I'll complete all 6 service layer tasks with tests, then stop for review).

Say **"Show Phase 1 breakdown"** to see detailed tasks first.
```

### ❌ WRONG: Execute All Phases Without Approval

```markdown
## ❌ BAD - Runs everything without checkpoints

**Execute All (Recommended):**
I'll complete all phases sequentially:
1. Update story (15 min)
2. Create docs (45 min)
3. Generate diagrams (20 min)
4. Deploy (5 min)

Say "Execute all" to start

❌ This removes user control
❌ Can't stop between phases
❌ No chance to review intermediate work
❌ Violates phase approval rule
```

**Why this is bad:**
- ❌ No control points between phases
- ❌ Can't review work quality incrementally
- ❌ Continues even if early phase has issues
- ❌ All-or-nothing approach
- ❌ Violates mandatory approval rule

### 🎯 Response Template Rules

**Rule 1: Always show complete plan upfront**
```markdown
✅ "4-Phase Plan: Phase 1 (3 tasks), Phase 2 (5 tasks)..." - Full visibility
✅ "Total: 85 minutes across 4 phases" - Set expectations

❌ "I'll do some work" - Vague scope
❌ "This will take a while" - No structure
```

**Rule 2: Execute one complete phase, then stop**
```markdown
✅ "Say 'Yes' to begin Phase 1 (I'll complete all 3 tasks, then stop)"
✅ "Phase 1 complete! Continue with Phase 2?"

❌ "Execute all phases" - No approval gates
❌ "Say 'continue' after each task" - Too granular
```

**Rule 3: Provide clear phase completion reports**
```markdown
✅ Phase deliverables listed
✅ Validation results shown
✅ Next phase described
✅ Explicit approval request

❌ "Done. Next?" - No details
❌ Automatic continuation
```

**Rule 4: Make approval clear and simple**
```markdown
✅ "Continue? Say 'Yes' to proceed or 'Stop' to review"
✅ Bold commands for easy identification

❌ "What would you like to do next?" - Open-ended
❌ "Ready?" - Unclear what happens
```

**Rule 5: Allow plan review before starting**
```markdown
✅ "Show me Phase 1 details" - Review tasks
✅ "Show root causes" - Understand before fixing
✅ "Explain the approach" - Understand strategy

❌ Only execution options
```

### 📝 Key Principles Summary

**The Complete Phase Rule in Action:**

1. **Plan First:** Show complete multi-phase plan upfront
2. **Execute One:** Complete entire phase (all tasks)
3. **Stop & Report:** Show what was delivered + validation
4. **Ask Approval:** Explicit user consent to continue
5. **Repeat:** Next phase when approved

**Benefits:**
- ✅ User maintains control at logical breakpoints
- ✅ Can review quality before committing more time
- ✅ Can change direction based on results
- ✅ Reduces risk of going down wrong path
- ✅ Natural pause points for testing/validation

**What This Prevents:**
- ❌ Stopping after task 1.1 (incomplete phase)
- ❌ Asking approval for every task (too granular)
- ❌ Running all phases automatically (no control)
- ❌ Vague completion (phase must be 100% done)

**This rule applies everywhere:**
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Test creation
- Refactoring work
- Setup sequences
- CORTEX 2.0 implementation

## ✨ Summary
````

**You asked:**
> "Will the CORTEX system benefit from SOLID principles?"

**Answer: ABSOLUTELY! v5.0 implements:**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility** - One agent = one job
- ✅ **Interface Segregation** - Dedicated agents (no mode switches)
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion** - Abstractions decouple from concrete implementations
- ✅ **Open/Closed** - Easy to extend without modifying existing code

**What changed:**
- ➕ Added `error-corrector.md` (dedicated correction agent)
- ➕ Added `session-resumer.md` (dedicated resumption agent)
- ➕ Added abstraction layer (`session-loader`, `test-runner`, `file-accessor`)
- ✅ Removed mode switches from `code-executor` and `work-planner`
- ✅ Decoupled agents from concrete file paths and tool commands

**Local-First Compliance:**
- ✅ **100% in KDS/** - All CORTEX logic, data, scripts housed locally
- ✅ **Minimal external dependencies** - Only CORTEX enhancement libraries (declared upfront)
- ✅ **Offline-capable** - Works without internet (core functionality)
- ✅ **Transparent setup** - User informed of all required libraries during setup
- ⚠️ **Optional extensions** - Cloud/database storage available but not required

**Dependency Categories:**
1. **CORTEX Core** - Zero dependencies (PowerShell/bash built-ins only)
2. **CORTEX Enhancements** - Open source libraries for improved capabilities (ALLOWED, declared at setup)
3. **Application Code** - User's project dependencies (Copilot recommends, user approves)
4. **Optional Features** - Cloud/DB/external services (opt-in only)

**What you need to remember:**
```
#file:KDS/prompts/user/cortex.md
[describe what you want]
```

**That's it. CORTEX handles the rest with SOLID principles and local-first design.** 🎯
