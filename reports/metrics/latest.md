## Self Review
- Independent system with no external dependencies: Yes — KDS core uses local files, scripts, and storage within KDS/, with optional enhancements only when explicitly approved.
- Efficiency: Yes — learning and context collection are throttled (e.g., Tier 3 hourly), and operations are designed to be lightweight by default.
- Following SOLID principles: Yes — specialist agents with single responsibilities and clear abstraction layers (DIP, ISP, SRP).
- Rulebook updated regularly: Unknown
- Comparable over time: Yes — this report is saved in a dated folder so you can trend and diff results.
- Metrics tracked in Git: Yes — reports are committed in the repository, enabling versioned comparisons.
