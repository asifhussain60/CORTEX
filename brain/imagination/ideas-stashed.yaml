      Transform KDS into brain-inspired 6-tier intelligence system:
      - Tier 0: Instinct (permanent core rules)
      - Tier 1: Working Memory (last 20 conversations)
      - Tier 2: Long-Term Memory (learned patterns)
      - Tier 3: Context Awareness (project intelligence)
      - Tier 4: Imagination (ideas and questions)
      - Tier 5: Housekeeping (automatic maintenance)

      Intelligent cleanup that removes:
      - Unused patterns (>90 days)
      - Low confidence patterns (<0.70)
      - Duplicate patterns (>85% similarity)
      - Stale conversations (FIFO queue)

      Transform static test scenarios into extensible YAML plugins:
      - 64+ test scenarios organized by tier
      - Pester framework integration
      - Historical result tracking
      - "Sharpen the brain" command

      Use PowerShell 7+ for ALL KDS functionality:
      - 130x smaller footprint vs hybrid approach
      - Zero external dependencies (except Pester)
      - Cross-platform compatible
      - Built-in HTTP server, YAML parsing

    benefits:
      - "Portability: Works anywhere PowerShell 7+ runs"
      - "Footprint: ~5 MB total (vs ~650 MB hybrid)"
      - "Maintenance: Single language"

      Use git commits for session state persistence:
      - Session start/pause/complete → git commit
      - Rich metadata in commit messages (YAML)
      - Git log as query engine
      - Crash recovery from git history
