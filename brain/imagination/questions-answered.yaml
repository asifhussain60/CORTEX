  why-brain-structure:
    question: "Why reorganize into brain-inspired structure?"

      Brain analogy makes structure intuitive:
      - Tier 0 (Instinct) = Brainstem (automatic)
      - Tier 1 (Working Memory) = Hippocampus (short-term)
      - Tier 2 (Long-Term) = Cortex (learned patterns)
      - Tier 3 (Context) = Prefrontal Cortex (planning)
      - Tier 4 (Imagination) = Creative Centers
      - Tier 5 (Housekeeping) = Cerebellum (automatic maintenance)

      Git-based backup is superior:
      ✅ Permanent history (no disk space waste)
      ✅ Easy rollback (git revert)
      ✅ Automatic versioning
      ✅ No separate backup files to manage

      Two-tier approach:
      1. Structured data: brain/imagination/ideas-stashed.yaml
      2. Detailed docs: docs/*.md
      3. Links: brain/imagination/semantic-links.yaml
      
      This keeps brain data structured while documentation stays readable.
