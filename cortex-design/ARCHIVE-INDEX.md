# CORTEX Documentation Archive Index

Purpose: Track documentation archived to Git history. Archived files are removed from the working directory but retrievable via the commit history.

Retrieval examples:
- Single file: `git show <commit>:<path> > restored-file.md`
- On GitHub: `https://github.com/asifhussain60/CORTEX/blob/<commit>/<path>` (repo will be renamed post Phase -2)
