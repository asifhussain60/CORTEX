    Multi-phase progressive implementation:
    - Phase 0: Test infrastructure first (TDD for TDD!)
    - Phases 1-3: RED→GREEN→REFACTOR automation in sequence
    - Phase 4: Validation & rollback safety net
    - Phase 5: Full integration into code-executor
    - Phase 6: Validation and Week 3 preparation
    
    This plan uses Week 1 hemisphere structure to organize work.
    Total tasks: 23 tasks across 6 phases.
    Estimated: 20-30 hours (Week 1 brain cannot estimate accurately yet).
