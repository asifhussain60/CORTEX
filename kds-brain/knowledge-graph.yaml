      - "Run script directly with test parameters"
      - "Fix any syntax errors (especially regex patterns)"
      - "Test with various input scenarios"
      - "Only then integrate with Start-Job orchestration"

    examples:
      single_quote: "\\x27 instead of `' or \\'"
      double_quote: "\\x22 instead of `\" or \\\""
      both: "[\\x27\\x22] matches both quote types"
    rationale: "Avoids PowerShell parsing ambiguity and escaping issues"
