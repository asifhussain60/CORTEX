# ADO Work Item Planning

**Instructions:** Fill out the 4 fields below, then say "import ado template" to save to CORTEX planning system.

## 📋 ADO Information

**ADO Number:**  
ADO-[Enter number, e.g., 12345]

**Type:** [Select ONE - delete others]
- Bug
- Feature  
- Task

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

**What must be true when this is complete?** Write specific, testable outcomes that describe WHAT should happen (not HOW).

Good acceptance criteria follow this pattern: "The [feature/system] should allow users to [action] under [conditions], resulting in [observable outcome]."

**Your Acceptance Criteria:**

1. [First criterion - describe expected behavior with specific conditions and measurable results]
2. [Second criterion - include edge cases, error scenarios, and how system should respond]
3. [Third criterion - define success clearly with observable outcomes or metrics]

*Add more as needed. Each should be verifiable and answer: "How will we know this is done correctly?"*

## 📝 Technical Notes

**Provide context to help developers understand dependencies, scope, and constraints.**

Include relevant details such as:
- Dependencies (APIs, libraries, other work items this relies on)
- Affected files/components (specific classes, modules, database tables)
- Architecture considerations (patterns, performance targets, security requirements)
- Integration points (external systems, APIs, services involved)
- Data changes (migrations, schema updates, transformations needed)

**Your Technical Notes:**

[Add implementation context here - dependencies, affected components, architecture decisions, performance/security requirements, and links to related work]

**Generated DoD:** *(Auto-generated based on Type when you import)*

**Next Steps:**
1. Fill out all fields above
2. Save this file (keep the filename or rename to describe the work)
3. Say "import ado template" to:
   - Generate smart Definition of Done based on Type
   - Save to SQLite with unique tracking ID
   - Hook into CORTEX planning system
   - Enable "resume ado [number]" command

**Template Version:** 2.0 (Simplified with Guidance)  
**CORTEX ADO Planning System**
