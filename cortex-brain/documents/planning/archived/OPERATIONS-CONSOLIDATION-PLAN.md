## Simplification Implementation Plan

### Core 7 Operations (Keep & Complete)

According to the strategy document, focus on these essential operations:

#### User Tier (4 operations)
1. **Demo** ✅ → `cortex_tutorial` (READY)
2. **Setup** 🔄 → `environment_setup` (UNKNOWN → Complete to READY)
3. **Feature Planning** 🎯 → `feature_planning` (DESIGNED → Complete to READY) 
4. **Application Onboarding** 🔄 → `application_onboarding` (IN PROGRESS → Complete to READY)

#### Admin Tier (3 operations)
5. **Design Sync** ✅ → `design_sync` (READY)
6. **Maintain** 🔄 → **NEW:** Consolidate `workspace_cleanup` + `optimize_cortex` + `brain_health_check`
7. **Document** 🔄 → **NEW:** Consolidate `refresh_cortex_story` + `update_documentation`

### Operations to Consolidate

#### Maintenance Operation (Consolidate 3 → 1)
- `workspace_cleanup` (READY) 
- `optimize_cortex` (READY)
- `brain_health_check` (DESIGNED)
- **Result:** Single `maintain_cortex` operation

#### Documentation Operation (Consolidate 2 → 1)
- `refresh_cortex_story` (UNKNOWN)
- `update_documentation` (UNKNOWN)  
- **Result:** Single `document_cortex` operation

### Operations to Mark as Experimental/Future

#### Move to Experimental Tier
- `brain_protection_check` (PENDING) → Experimental (Tier 0 handles this)
- `deploy_to_app` (DESIGNED) → Future feature
- `comprehensive_self_review` (UNKNOWN) → Experimental
- `architecture_planning` (UNKNOWN) → Advanced feature
- `refactoring_planning` (UNKNOWN) → Advanced feature

#### Integrate into Core Operations  
- `run_tests` (UNKNOWN) → Integrate into other operations as validation
- `interactive_planning` (UNKNOWN) → Merge into `feature_planning`
- `command_help` (UNKNOWN) → Integrate into help system
- `command_search` (UNKNOWN) → Integrate into help system

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Complete Core Operations (Week 1)
1. Complete `environment_setup` to READY status
2. Complete `feature_planning` to READY status  
3. Complete `application_onboarding` to READY status
4. Create new `maintain_cortex` operation (consolidate 3)
5. Create new `document_cortex` operation (consolidate 2)

### Phase 2: Mark Experimental Operations (Week 1)
1. Move experimental operations to separate tier
2. Update operation routing to focus on core 7
3. Clear documentation about experimental vs core

### Expected Results
- **Before:** 19 operations (4 ready, 15 mixed status)
- **After:** 7 core operations (all ready) + 5 experimental operations
- **Reduction:** 68% fewer operations in main interface
- **Reliability:** 100% ready status for core operations

## Next Actions
1. Implement consolidation of maintenance operations
2. Implement consolidation of documentation operations  
3. Complete UNKNOWN/DESIGNED operations to READY status
4. Update operation routing and help system
5. Move experimental operations to separate tier
