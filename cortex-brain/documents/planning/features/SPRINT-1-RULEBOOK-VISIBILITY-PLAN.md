# Sprint 1: Rulebook Visibility Enhancement

**Sprint Duration:** December 2-6, 2025 (1 week)  
**Sprint Goal:** Implement governance rulebook visibility at all CORTEX entry points  
**Priority:** HIGH (User awareness of governance system)  
**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

**Problem Statement:**
Users interact with CORTEX without knowing 27 governance rules exist. Brain protection operates invisibly, leading to confusion when operations are blocked. Need proactive rule visibility to build user trust and understanding.

**Solution:**
Implement 4-layer visibility strategy: welcome banner, help enhancement, first-time acknowledgment flow, and compliance dashboard integration.

**Success Metrics:**
- 100% users see rulebook reference on first interaction
- Help command includes dedicated rulebook section
- Compliance dashboard accessible via natural language
- Zero confusion about blocked operations (users know why)

---

## 🎯 User Stories

### Story 1: Welcome Banner (Priority: CRITICAL)

**As a** CORTEX user

### Data Flow

```
User: First CORTEX interaction
   ↓
UnifiedEntryPointOrchestrator
   ↓
WelcomeBannerAgent.should_display()
   ├─ Check Tier 1 session state
   └─ If first interaction → Display banner
   ↓
User: "help"
   ↓
HelpAgent.execute()
   ├─ Load help_table template
   └─ Include governance section
   ↓
User: "show compliance"
   ↓
ComplianceDashboardAgent.execute()
   ├─ Fetch compliance from Tier 1

```

### Database Schema Changes

**Tier 1: working_memory.db**

```sql
-- Add to user_profile table (if not exists)
ALTER TABLE user_profile 
ADD COLUMN acknowledged_rulebook INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Add session tracking table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS session_state (
    session_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    banner_shown INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    started_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_activity TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: User Overwhelm (MEDIUM)

**Description:** Welcome banner + onboarding step may feel like too much governance messaging

**Mitigation:**
- Make banner dismissible
- Onboarding step optional ("Skip" button)
- Tone: Informative, not preachy
- Keep messages <3 sentences

**Contingency:** If user feedback negative, make banner opt-out via profile setting

---

### Risk 2: Simple Browser Not Available (LOW)

**Description:** VS Code Simple Browser may not work in all environments

**Mitigation:**
- Fallback: Generate HTML file and provide file path
- Check Simple Browser availability before opening
- Graceful degradation message

**Contingency:** Create CLI-based compliance display (table format)

---

### Risk 3: Session Tracking Complexity (LOW)

**Description:** Session state tracking may have edge cases (crashes, restarts)

**Mitigation:**
- Use session ID (timestamp-based)
- Expire sessions after 4 hours of inactivity
- Clear session state on explicit logout

**Contingency:** Default to showing banner if session state unclear (better to over-show than miss)
