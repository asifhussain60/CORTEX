## Definitions

Listed below is a survey of privacy terminology. The list is not comprehensive but highlights major considerations and shows the spectrum of data that must be managed by the Company under various legal standards. 



| Category | Terms and Definitions |
| --- | --- |
| Protected Information (“PI”) | Protected Information is a broad category, that includes other privacy categories such as NPI, PHI, and PII (defined below).
Any representation of information that permits the identity of an individual to whom the information applies to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means. Further, Protected Information is defined as information: (i) that directly identifies an individual (e.g., name, address, social security number or other identifying number or code, telephone number, email address, etc.) or (ii) by which an agency intends to identify specific individuals in conjunction with other data elements, i.e., indirect identification. (These data elements may include a combination of gender, race, birth date, geographic indicator, and other descriptors). Additionally, information permitting the physical or online contacting of a specific individual is the same as Protected Information. This information can be maintained in either paper, electronic or other media.
The Company does not collect Protected Information from children under the age of 18, however, plan sponsors and participants, and HSA owners may upload dependent information for payment or recordkeeping purposes. |
| Nonpublic Personal Information (“NPI”) | Product: HSA, Commuter, Dependent Care FSA, Employer-Sponsored Programs subject to GLBA (check with Privacy Team) 
Source: Account holder directly or through their agent (e.g., employers/partners)
Owner: HSA Custodian, subject to IRS record retention requirements

Defined by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”) Privacy Rule.
Any “personally identifiable financial information” that a financial institution collects about an individual in connection with providing a financial product or service, unless that information is otherwise “publicly available”. 
NPI includes, among other things, an HSA member’s name and contact information, information submitted an individual (either directly or through an employer or other agent) in an HSA application, transaction information, and the mere fact that an individual has an HSA administered by the Company. |
| Protected Health Information (“PHI”) | Client PHI
Product: Health FSA, HRA, Retiree HRA, Continuation Coverage (e.g., COBRA, Direct Bill), Employer-Sponsored Programs subject to HIPAA (check with Privacy Team)
Source: HIPAA covered entity (and related parties)
Owner: HIPAA covered entity / plan participant

Defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”).
The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federal protections for PHI held by HIPAA covered entities and business associates and gives patients an array of rights with respect to that information. 
The Privacy Rule protects all “individually identifiable health information” held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate, in any form or media, whether electronic, paper, or oral. The Privacy Rule calls this information PHI. “Individually identifiable health information” is information, including demographic data, that relates to: (i) the individual’s past, present or future physical or mental health or condition, (ii) the provision of health care to the individual, or (iii) the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to the individual, and that (iv) identifies the individual or for which there is a reasonable basis to believe it can be used to identify the individual. Individually identifiable health information includes many common identifiers (e.g., name, address, birth date, Social Security Number).
The Company is not a HIPAA covered entity in the provision of products or services. Rather it is a HIPAA business associate or subcontractor business associate.
