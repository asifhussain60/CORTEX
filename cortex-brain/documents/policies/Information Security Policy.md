## Purpose and scope

The HealthEquity, Inc. (“Company”) *Information Security Policy* (“Policy”) sets forth the Company’s requirements for the management of information security risk. This Policy applies to (i) all Company affiliates and subsidiaries, unless a separate policy is approved for the specific entity; (ii) all team members, contractors, consultants, and Operations Partners (“Workforce”) that have access to Company information or information systems; and (iii) all information systems and services, whether on or off premises, which are used to store, process, view, or transmit Company information.


The goals of this Policy include the following:  


Protect information relating to the Company, members, clients/employers/partners, and shareholders.

Manage risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, networks, and systems. 

Reduce potential disruption to information systems and the unauthorized modification, use, and disclosure of information. 

Comply with contractual obligations and applicable laws and regulations.

Define general roles and responsibilities of team members throughout the organization. 

Support cybersecurity business objectives, such as SOC 1 and SOC 2 certifications.

Utilize NIST Cybersecurity framework as a guideline to ensure organizational adherence to approved best standards and practices.

## Definitions

When used in the context of this Policy, the following definitions apply.



| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Critical infrastructure | Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on cybersecurity, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters. |
| Cybersecurity | The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks. |
| Cybersecurity event | A cybersecurity change that may have an impact on organizational operations (including mission, capabilities, or reputation). |
| Cybersecurity incident | A cybersecurity event that has been determined to have an impact on the organization prompting the need for response and recovery. |
| Mobile code | A program (e.g., script, macro, or other portable instruction) that can be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and executed with identical semantics. |
| NIST CSF 2.0 | Cybersecurity framework defined by NIST and employed by the Company. The functions are listed and addressed in more detail in Section 4 (Requirements).
Govern - The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy, expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. This function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and stakeholder expectations.
Identify – The organization’s current cybersecurity risks are understood. Understanding the organization’s assets (e.g., data, hardware, software, systems, facilities, services, people), suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy.
Protect – Safeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risks are used. Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized, this supports the ability to secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity events, as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking advantage of opportunities.
Detect – Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed. This enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity attacks and incidents are occurring. 
Respond – Actions regarding a detected cybersecurity incident are taken. This supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting, and communication.
Recover – Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored. This supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts. While many cybersecurity risk management activities focus on preventing negative events from occurring, they may also support taking advantage of positive opportunities. |
| Operations Partner | Product and service providers used for an organization’s internal purposes (e.g., IT infrastructure) or integrated into the products of services provided to that organization’s buyers. See Operations Partner Program. |
| Privileged user | A user that is authorized (and, therefore, trusted) to perform security-relevant functions that ordinary users are not authorized to perform. |
| Risk | A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of (i) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (ii) the likelihood of occurrence. |
| Threat | Any potential event or action that could cause hard to an organizations information system. Examples include cyber-attacks, natural disasters and insider threats. |
| Vulnerability | A weakness or flaw in a system, process, or security measure that can be exploited by a threat to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. |
| Confidentiality | Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes |
| Integrity | Maintaining the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods. |
| Availability | Ensure that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required. |

## Requirements

The Company’s senior leadership team affirms its commitment to securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information with which it has been entrusted. The Company takes a risk-based approach to information security, which allocates resources to protect Company, employer, partner, and member information, and information, systems, and networks based on threats and their likelihood of causing an adverse outcome. This approach balances the Company’s information security goals with its other values, obligations and interests. 


The Company uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF 2.0 will be noted as “NIST CSF” for the remainder of the document) to organize its information security policies and practices. NIST CSF is widely recognized as an authoritative commercial framework for information security and that helps the Company satisfy its legal and regulatory requirements. NIST CSF organizes basic information security related activities into the NIST CSF functions. These functions are meant to be high-level and include Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Each function is further organized into categories and expected outcomes, as outlined below (NIST subcategory citations are provided in parentheses along with each requirement).

### Govern

This function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and 

prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and 

stakeholder expectations. Governance activities are critical for incorporating cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management (ERM) strategy. Govern addresses an understanding of organizational context; the establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; policy; and the oversight of cybersecurity strategy.
