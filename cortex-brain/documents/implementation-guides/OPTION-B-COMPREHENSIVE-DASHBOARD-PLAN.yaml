    This plan integrates TWO complementary dashboard systems:
    
    **Sprints 1-4 (Weeks 1-4): Governance & Rulebook Visibility**
    - User-facing compliance dashboard
    - Rulebook acknowledgment flow
    - Interactive rule explorer
    - User profile integration
    
    **Sprints 5-8 (Weeks 5-8): D3.js Admin Dashboards**
    - Interactive admin operation dashboards
    - Real-time WebSocket monitoring
    - Visual feedback for sync/optimize/deploy
    - Format validation & deployment gates
    
    Both systems share the WebSocket server infrastructure built in Sprint 2.

vision:
  statement: "CORTEX vision is to provide transparent, proactive governance where rules guide development rather than block it."
  clarification: "This is our internal engineering standard, not a customer promise. It represents how we build CORTEX to serve users effectively."
  
  core_principles:
    - "Rules are visible before they're violated"
    - "Enforcement is educational, not punitive"
    - "Users understand why rules exist"
    - "Compliance is measurable and trackable"
    - "Governance adapts to user experience level"

strategic_goals:
  primary:
    - "Zero surprise violations - users see rules before breaking them"
    - "100% rulebook acknowledgment during onboarding"
    - "Real-time compliance visibility via dashboard"
    - "Educational enforcement - users learn from protection events"
    - "Cross-machine accessibility - plan tracked in git"
  
  secondary:
    - "Integration with User Profile System for adaptive guidance"
    - "Foundation for CORTEX 4.0 Right Brain strategic features"
    - "Measurable improvement in user satisfaction (NPS tracking)"
    - "Reduced friction between users and Brain Protector"

architecture:
  current_state:
    enforcement: "Strong - 27 rules, 10 layers, BrainProtector agent"
    visibility: "Weak - Rulebook hidden in docs/governance/"
    user_experience: "Reactive - Users discover rules when violated"
    documentation: "Comprehensive but not surfaced proactively"
    
  target_state:
    enforcement: "Enhanced - Same strong foundation + user education"
    visibility: "Proactive - Multi-touchpoint display (greeting, help, pre-flight)"
    user_experience: "Guided - Rules presented before work begins"
    documentation: "Dynamic - Dashboard shows real-time compliance"
    integration: "Seamless - Rulebook wired into all entry points"

          🎯 **Welcome to CORTEX!**
          
          Before we begin, let's review the core principles that guide CORTEX development:
          
          **CORTEX Vision:**
          - TDD Enforcement (tests before code)
          - Brain Protection (27 automated rules)
          - SOLID Principles (clean architecture)
          - Incremental Planning (YAML-driven)
          
          These are our internal engineering standards documented in [THE RULEBOOK](../docs/governance/THE-RULEBOOK.md).
          
          **Type 'acknowledge' to confirm you've reviewed these principles, or 'read more' for detailed governance.**

# ============================================================================
# CONCLUSION
# ============================================================================

conclusion:
  summary: |
    Option B (Comprehensive Dashboard - 8 weeks) delivers both user-facing governance
    visibility (Weeks 1-4) and professional admin-facing D3.js interactive dashboards
    (Weeks 5-8). This integrated approach provides optimal balance between:
    
    • Immediate impact through proactive governance visibility (Sprints 1-4)
    • Strategic foundation with admin operational intelligence (Sprints 5-8)
    
    By implementing compliance monitoring, interactive rule exploration, AND real-time
    WebSocket dashboards with visual operation feedback, CORTEX significantly
    differentiates from GitHub Copilot with the "wow factor" of professional
    interactive dashboards.
    
    This plan transforms governance from reactive enforcement into proactive guidance,
    while giving admins unprecedented visibility into CORTEX operations through
    stunning D3.js visualizations.
  
  next_steps:
    - "Get integrated 8-week plan approved by stakeholders"
    - "Allocate team resources (1 developer, 1 week per sprint)"
    - "Set sprint start dates"
    - "Kick off Sprint 1 (Immediate Visibility Enhancement)"
    - "Consider phased rollout: Complete Sprints 1-4 first, evaluate, then Sprints 5-8"
  
  vision_statement: |
    CORTEX vision is to build AI assistance that operates transparently under
    well-defined engineering standards. These rules are not promises to customers -
    they are our internal commitment to code quality, architectural integrity, and
    sustainable development practices.
    
    By making these standards visible and educational (Sprints 1-4), we empower
    users to work with CORTEX effectively. By providing interactive admin dashboards
    with real-time operational intelligence (Sprints 5-8), we give administrators
    unprecedented insight into system health, performance, and compliance.
    
    Together, these capabilities position CORTEX as a best-in-class AI development
    assistant with enterprise-grade governance visibility and operational excellence.
