# CORTEX Feature Planning

This diagram shows CORTEX's structured approach to planning new features.

**User** describes desired feature in natural language.

**Work Planner Agent** analyzes request, identifies requirements, and generates planning template.

**ADO Form** is a structured document with Definition of Ready (DoR), Definition of Done (DoD), acceptance criteria, and implementation checklist.

**Approved** status triggers automatic task generation and progress tracking.

**Pipeline** executes implementation with TDD (Test-Driven Development), validation, and documentation.

This workflow ensures zero ambiguity - every feature is fully specified before implementation begins. No "figure it out as we go" - CORTEX demands clarity upfront.
