# CORTEX Executive Summary

## Overview

CORTEX (Cognitive Operation & Reasoning Through EXtension) is an advanced AI assistant system built on GitHub Copilot Chat, designed to provide intelligent, context-aware development assistance with multi-tier memory architecture.

## Key Capabilities

This section provides information about key capabilities. See related documentation in the navigation menu for detailed guides.


### 🧠 Multi-Tier Memory System

**Tier 0: Brain Protection (SKULL)**
- Immutable core rules protecting CORTEX integrity
- 22 brain protection tests (100% pass rate)
- Prevents accidental corruption of core functionality

**Tier 1: Working Memory**
- Conversation history and context tracking
- Active development context
- Session state management
- Auto-injection of relevant past conversations

**Tier 2: Knowledge Graph**
- Learned patterns and relationships
- Cross-project insights
- Architecture patterns
- Best practices database

**Tier 3: Development Context**
- Project-specific knowledge
- Technology stack patterns
- Team workflows
- Custom configurations

### ⚡ Key Features

**TDD Mastery**
- RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle automation
- Auto-debug on test failures
- Performance-based refactoring suggestions
- Test location isolation (user repo vs CORTEX)
- 60+ min manual work → <5 min automated

**Feature Planning System 2.0**
- Vision API integration (extract from screenshots)
- DoR/DoD enforcement (zero-ambiguity validation)
- OWASP security review integration
- File-based planning workflow
- ADO work item integration

**View Discovery Agent**
- Auto-discover element IDs from Razor/Blazor files
- 92% time savings (60+ min → <5 min)
- 95%+ test accuracy with real IDs
- Integrated with TDD workflow

**System Alignment**
- Convention-based feature discovery
- 7-layer integration scoring
- Auto-generates wiring/tests/docs templates
- Deployment quality gates

**Universal Upgrade System**
- Auto-detects standalone/embedded installations
- Automatic brain data backup
- Database migration automation
- Post-upgrade validation (834 tests)

### 📊 Performance Metrics

**Token Optimization**
- 97.2% input token reduction (74,047 → 2,078 avg)
- 93.4% cost reduction with GitHub Copilot pricing
- Projected savings: $8,636/year (1,000 requests/month)
- 97% faster parsing (2-3s → 80ms)

**Code Quality**
- 834/897 tests passing (93% pass rate)
- Phase 0 complete: 100% test pass rate on core functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage across all tiers

**Developer Productivity**
- 60+ min manual discovery → <5 min automated (View Discovery)
- 95%+ test accuracy (vs 40-60% with manual selectors)
- Zero-intervention workflows (auto-debug, auto-feedback)

## Architecture Highlights

This section provides information about architecture highlights. See related documentation in the navigation menu for detailed guides.


### Modular Design
- Template-based responses (30+ templates)
- Pluggable agent system
- Convention-based discovery
- File-based planning workflow

### Privacy & Security
- All data stored locally
- No external API calls (except optional GitHub Gist)
- OWASP security review in planning
- Brain protection rules (SKULL system)

### Cross-Platform Support
- Mac, Windows, Linux
- Standalone or embedded installation
- Git-based or file-based upgrades
- Workspace-aware operations

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone repository or use embedded setup
2. **Configuration**: Run `setup environment` command
3. **Usage**: Natural language commands (no syntax to memorize)
4. **Planning**: Use `plan [feature]` for structured feature planning
5. **TDD**: Use `start tdd` for test-driven development workflow

## Documentation Structure

- **User Guides**: Getting started, planning, TDD, troubleshooting
- **Reference**: API documentation, configuration, response templates
- **Architecture**: Tier system, agents, brain protection
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples (NOOR CANVAS refactoring)
- **Operations**: Workflows, health monitoring, entry point modules

## Version Information
