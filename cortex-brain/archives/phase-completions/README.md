## 🎯 Why Archived?

These files were moved to archives for the following reasons:

1. **Completion Status:** All phases documented are complete
2. **Historical Value:** Useful for reference but not active development
3. **Brain Optimization:** Active brain directory should contain only current working docs
4. **Token Efficiency:** Reduces cognitive load when scanning brain directory

## 📚 How to Use

### When to Reference These Files

**Use Case 1: Historical Context**
- "When did we implement the three-tier architecture?"
- "What decisions were made during Phase 1.5?"
- "What was the original implementation approach?"

**Use Case 2: Pattern Recognition**
- "Has this problem been solved before?"
- "What challenges did we face with X feature?"
- "What was the original design rationale?"

**Use Case 3: Audit & Review**
- Compliance reviews
- Post-mortem analysis
- Architecture decision records

### How to Access

```bash
# Navigate to archives
cd $CORTEX_ROOT/cortex-brain/archives/phase-completions

# Search for specific topic
grep -r "conversation tracking" *.md

# View specific completion report
cat PHASE-3.1-COMPLETE.md
```
