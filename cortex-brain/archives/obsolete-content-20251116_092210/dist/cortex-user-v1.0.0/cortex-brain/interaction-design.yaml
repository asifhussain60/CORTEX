interaction_design:
  philosophy: Natural language only - intuitive, flexible, maintainable
  decision_date: '2025-11-10'
  rationale:
  - Simpler mental model (one way to interact)
  - More intuitive for all user levels
  - Less documentation overhead
  - Natural language already works perfectly
  - Eliminates syntax errors
  - Reduces maintenance burden
  natural_language_patterns:
    terse:
      description: Single word commands (fast for power users)
      examples:
      - setup
      - cleanup
      - demo
      - help
    clear:
      description: Clear intent phrases (recommended)
      examples:
      - setup environment
      - clean workspace
      - show me what cortex can do
      - refresh cortex story
    conversational:
      description: Natural conversation (most flexible)
      examples:
      - I want to set up my environment
      - Can you clean up temporary files?
      - Show me how to use CORTEX
      - Let's plan a new feature
  intent_detection:
    method: Semantic matching on natural_language field
    fallback: If no match, show help with suggestions
    confidence_threshold: 0.75
    fuzzy_matching: true
  command_discovery:
    primary: help command shows all operations
    search: Semantic search through operation descriptions
    suggestions: Context-aware based on project state
    examples: Every operation lists natural language examples
  vs_code_extension:
    note: VS Code extension MAY use slash commands internally
    reason: UI conventions (e.g., /resume, /history)
    scope: Extension only, not core CORTEX
    documentation: Documented separately from main operations
  migration_notes:
    removed: All slash_command fields from cortex-operations.yaml
    kept: All natural_language arrays (primary interaction method)
    impact: None - natural language already working
    documentation_cleanup:
    - CORTEX.prompt.md - remove slash command sections
    - Help system - remove slash command column
    - Technical docs - emphasize natural language only
