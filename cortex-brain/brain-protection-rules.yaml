        rationale: |
          Brain protection tests validate core CORTEX integrity:
          - Path handling (cross-platform compatibility)
          - Protection layer logic (architectural safeguards)
          - Conversation tracking (memory system)
          - YAML configuration loading (governance rules)
          
          If these fail, CORTEX has fundamental issues that MUST be resolved.
          100% pass rate is MANDATORY before any other work continues.

        rationale: |
          CORTEX 2.0 efficiency principles:
          
          USE MARKDOWN FOR:
          - User guides and tutorials
          - Narrative documentation (stories, history)
          - Architecture explanations
          - Design rationale
          
          USE YAML/JSON FOR:
          - Structured data (capabilities, status, priorities)
          - Configuration and rules
          - Metrics and statistics
          - Patterns and templates
          - API schemas
          
          USE CODE FILES FOR:
          - Implementation examples
          - Code snippets and patterns
          - Reusable templates
          
          Benefits:
          - 60% token reduction in context injection
          - Automated validation and schema checking
          - Better version control diffs
          - Direct machine consumption
          - No documentation drift

        evidence_template: |
          Passive narrator detected: '{match}'
          
          Story should be ACTIVE third-person narrative, not clinical documentation.
          
          Examples:
          ❌ "Asif Codeinstein designed..." ← documentation
          ✅ "So Asif built..." ← storytelling
          
          ❌ "He wrote routines for..." ← neutral observer  
          ✅ "He grabbed his keyboard and..." ← immediate action
          
          ❌ "One evening, while reviewing..." ← documentary
          ✅ "That evening, knee-deep in..." ← vivid scene
        
        rationale: |
          CORTEX story is a COMEDY told by an energetic narrator, not a memoir or
          technical documentation. Third-person is CORRECT, but it must be ACTIVE
          storytelling with personality, immediacy, and energy.
          
          The narrator is a CHARACTER in the story—witty, observant, timing jokes.
          Not a clinical observer reporting facts.
          
          TRANSFORMATION PATTERNS:
          
          Passive → Active:
          - "designed a system" → "So Asif built a system"
          - "wrote routines for" → "grabbed his keyboard and coded"
          - "One evening, while reviewing" → "That evening, knee-deep in"
          - "made a decision" → "stared at the screen and decided"
          - "implemented the feature" → "dove into implementing"
          - "After completing X, he" → "X complete, Asif leaned back and"
          
          PRESERVE:
          - Third-person perspective (it's a STORY about Asif, not BY Asif)
          - Narrator personality and comedy
          - Technical content and accuracy
          - Character name "Asif Codeinstein"
          
          AVOID:
          - First-person memoir style ("I designed...")
          - Clinical/academic tone ("The system was designed to...")
          - Passive voice constructions
          - Documentary-style time markers
