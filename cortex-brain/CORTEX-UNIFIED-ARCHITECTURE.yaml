# 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
# ===========================================

system_overview:
  name: "CORTEX"
  full_name: "Cognitive framework for Optimized Reasoning, Tracking, and Extensible eXecution"
  tagline: "The Intern with Amnesia - Now with Memory"
  version: "2.0"
  
  purpose: |
    CORTEX transforms GitHub Copilot from an amnesiac assistant into a continuously 
    improving development partner through long-term memory, context awareness, and 
    strategic planning capabilities.
  
  core_problem: |
    GitHub Copilot Chat doesn't preserve conversation history across sessions, 
    causing it to "forget" previous discussions and requiring users to repeat 
    context. This makes features like "make it purple" (referencing earlier work) 
    impossible without manual context reinjection.
  
  solution_approach: |
    Four-tier brain architecture (Instinct, Memory, Knowledge, Context) combined 
    with 10 specialist agents provides both short-term memory (last 20 conversations) 
    and long-term learning (accumulated patterns in knowledge graph).
  
  key_capabilities:
    - conversation_memory: "Last 20 conversations preserved across sessions"
    - pattern_learning: "Accumulates wisdom from every interaction"
    - intent_routing: "Automatically detects user intent and routes to specialist agents"
    - cross_platform: "Works seamlessly on Mac, Windows, Linux"
    - extensible: "Plugin system for custom functionality"
    - modular: "97.2% token reduction through modular architecture"

  # 2.4 Plugin System
  # ------------------------------------
  
  plugin_system:
    overview: |
      Extensible plugin architecture allows adding custom functionality without 
      modifying CORTEX core. Plugins inherit from BasePlugin and register via 
      PluginRegistry.
    
    architecture:
      base_class: "BasePlugin (src/plugins/base_plugin.py)"
      registry: "PluginRegistry (src/plugins/plugin_registry.py)"
      command_registry: "CommandRegistry (src/plugins/command_registry.py)"
      lifecycle: "initialize → execute → cleanup"
      
    characteristics:
      - inheritance: "All plugins inherit from BasePlugin"
      - registration: "Auto-discovered via register() function"
      - commands: "Plugins can register slash commands"
      - isolation: "Plugins isolated from each other"
      - testing: "Comprehensive test harnesses required"
