      changes:
        - "MAJOR: Converted from two-track parallel to single-track fast execution"
        - "Timeline compressed: 17 weeks → 11 weeks (35% faster)"
        - "Eliminated convergence overhead (no multi-machine merge)"
        - "Reordered: Quick wins first (Week 1-2), high-value second (Week 3-8), validation last (Week 9-11)"
        - "Track B Phase B1/B2 already complete (75/100 baseline, 58K tokens saved)"
        - "Deferred Track B remaining work (B2.3, B3, B4) to post-3.0 maintenance"
        - "EPMO Health (Track A) reduced to minimum scope needed to unblock Feature 4"
        - "Single developer workflow - no coordination overhead"
    
    - date: "2025-11-16"

        - "[ARCHIVED] Method 1 now two-step: '/CORTEX Capture' creates empty file, '/CORTEX Import' imports after paste"
    
    - date: "2025-11-16"
      version: "3.0.1"
      changes:

    rationale: |
      Single-track execution eliminates coordination overhead and delivers
      features faster. Track B foundation is solid (75/100 baseline), making
      remaining optimization work optional for 3.0 release.

    critical_path:
      - "Quick wins (Features 2, 3, 5.1) unlock momentum in Week 1-2"
      - "EPMO Health (A1-A6) must complete by Week 9 to unblock Feature 4"
      - "Feature 1 (IDEA Capture) runs in parallel with early EPMO Health phases"
    
    deferred_to_post_3_0:
      - "Track B Phase B2.3: Lazy Loading (6 hours, HIGH priority)"
      - "Track B Phase B3: SRP Refactoring (24 hours, MEDIUM priority)"
      - "Track B Phase B4: MD-to-YAML (16 hours, LOW priority)"

      Automated documentation generator for Entry Point Module (EPM)
      orchestrators. Analyzes Python code and generates comprehensive
      markdown documentation with diagrams, examples, and API specs.
    
    strategic_value:
      automation: "Eliminates manual documentation maintenance"

      rationale: |
        EPM doc generator analyzes orchestrator code structure, dependencies,
        and module coordination. If EPMOs are bloated (>500 lines), have
        circular dependencies, or violate SOLID principles, generated docs
        will be confusing or incorrect. Must wait for EPMO health remediation
        before generating documentation.

  # ========================================================================

    duration_weeks: 2
    effort_hours: 96
    
    rationale: |
      CORTEX 2.0 achieved 97.2% token reduction but left technical debt:
      - 4 invalid YAML files break validation
      - 4 plugins fail registration
      - 773,866 tokens still in instruction files (should be <200K)
      - brain-protection-rules.yaml violates SRP (1,000+ lines, multiple concerns)
      
      These issues block stable feature development. Must fix foundation first.
