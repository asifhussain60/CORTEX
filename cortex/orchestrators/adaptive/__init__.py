"""Adaptive Execution Framework

Implements context-aware orchestrator routing and optimization for CORTEX.

Modules:
    execution_context_analyzer: ExecutionContextAnalyzer for task analysis
    routing_engine: OrchestratorRoutingEngine for intelligent orchestrator selection
    execution_modes: ExecutionMode enums and mode handlers
    caching_layer: CachingLayer for result caching with TTL
    performance_profiler: PerformanceProfiler for execution profiling
    unified_adaptive_layer: UnifiedAdaptiveLayer consolidating all adaptive components
