## The Sacred Rules of CORTEX

*Inscribed in the foundations of intelligence*

### Layer I: Core Instincts

**Rule 1: Test-First Development**  
Write the failing test first, make it pass, then refine. This is the way.

**Rule 2: Definition of Done**  
Work is complete only when zero errors remain, zero warnings persist, all tests pass, and the application runs.

**Rule 3: Definition of Ready**  
Begin not until requirements are clear, acceptance criteria defined, and no blockers remain.

**Rule 4: Brain Protection Tests**  
The sacred tests of brain health must always pass. If they fail, all work ceases.

**Rule 5: Machine-Readable Formats**  
Use YAML for configuration, JSON for data, Markdown for narratives. Sixty percent more efficient.

### Layer II: Tier Boundaries

**Rule 6: Tier Zero is Immutable**  
The instinct layer changes not during execution. Only through deliberate ceremony may it be altered.

**Rule 7: Tier Isolation**  
Each tier serves its purpose alone: Memory, Knowledge, Context, Events. None shall trespass.

**Rule 8: No Cross-Tier Pollution**  
Let not the working memory seep into the knowledge graph. Separation brings clarity.

### Layer III: SOLID Principles

**Rule 9: Single Responsibility**  
Each module performs one task excellently. Confusion comes from doing too much.

**Rule 10: Open for Extension, Closed for Modification**  
The core remains stable. New capabilities arrive through plugins, not through alteration.

### Layer IV: Hemisphere Separation

**Rule 14: LEFT Brain = Tactical Execution**  
The left hemisphere builds, tests, fixes, commits. It acts with precision.

**Rule 15: RIGHT Brain = Strategic Planning**  
The right hemisphere plans, assesses risk, finds patterns, makes decisions. It thinks with wisdom.

**Rule 16: The Corpus Callosum Coordinates**  
Message queue connects the hemispheres. Asynchronous communication prevents chaos.

### Layer V: Knowledge Quality

**Rule 17: Patterns Require Three Examples**  
One instance is chance. Two is coincidence. Three is a pattern worth remembering.

**Rule 18: Validate Before Using**  
Test each pattern before trusting it. The codebase changes; patterns must adapt.

**Rule 19: Knowledge Expires**  
After ninety days, patterns must be re-validated. Staleness breeds error.

### Layer VI: The Twenty-Second Rule

**Rule 22: Challenge Bad Ideas**  
The system must challenge risky changes—even those from its creator. Especially those from its creator.

*These rules are not suggestions. They are the foundation upon which intelligence is built.*

## ⚡ The Solution: CORTEX

CORTEX is a sophisticated cognitive architecture that gives Copilot a permanent, learning brain:

### 🧠 **Dual-Hemisphere Brain**

<span class="left-brain">LEFT BRAIN - Tactical Executor</span> Precise TDD implementation, code execution, validation

<span class="right-brain">RIGHT BRAIN - Strategic Planner</span> Architecture design, pattern recognition, proactive planning

**Corpus Callosum** - Message bridge coordinating hemispheres

### 🗂️ **Five-Tier Memory System**

| Tier | Type | Purpose | Storage |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **Tier 0** | Instinct | Immutable core values (TDD, SOLID, DoR/DoD) | `governance/rules.md` |
| **Tier 1** | Short-Term | Last 20 conversations (FIFO queue) | `conversation-history.jsonl` |
| **Tier 2** | Long-Term | Learned patterns and knowledge graph | `knowledge-graph.yaml` |
| **Tier 3** | Context | Development metrics and project intelligence | `development-context.yaml` |
| **Tier 4** | Event Stream | Life recorder for automatic learning | `events.jsonl` |

### 🛡️ **Six-Layer Protection System**

1. **Instinct Immutability** - Challenges TDD violations
2. **Tier Boundary Protection** - Ensures correct data placement
3. **SOLID Compliance** - Enforces single responsibility
4. **Hemisphere Specialization** - Routes to correct brain hemisphere
5. **Knowledge Quality** - Pattern decay and consolidation
6. **Commit Integrity** - Git protection and semantic commits

### ✅ **60 Sacred Tests**

Comprehensive test suite validating all cognitive functions:
- 60/60 passing ⭐
- 100% coverage of memory, protection, and coordination
- Validates dual-hemisphere coordination
- Ensures tier boundaries are respected

### 🕷️ **Oracle Crawler**

Deep codebase scanner that discovers:
- 1,000+ files and relationships
- UI element ID mapping for robust tests
- Pattern discovery and classification
- Feeds knowledge graph automatically

### The Awakening of CORTEX: A Five-Act Journey

Experience the complete narrative of CORTEX's creation through five chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: The Problem** - A mad scientist discovers Copilot's amnesia
2. **Chapter 2: The Solution** - Dual-hemisphere brain + Oracle Crawler
3. **Chapter 3: The Memory** - Five-tier intelligence system
4. **Chapter 4: The Protection** - Six-layer immune system
5. **Chapter 5: The Activation** - 60 tests + first successful execution

Each chapter blends narrative storytelling with technical deep-dives and visual diagrams.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The only command you need to remember:

```markdown
#file:CORTEX/prompts/user/cortex.md

[Your request in natural language - CORTEX handles everything]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
#file:CORTEX/prompts/user/cortex.md

Add a purple button to the Host Control Panel
```

**CORTEX automatically:**

✅ Analyzes intent (<span class="right-brain">RIGHT BRAIN</span> queries 3 memory tiers)  
✅ Creates strategic plan (phases, warnings, estimates)  
✅ Executes with TDD (<span class="left-brain">LEFT BRAIN</span>: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR)  
✅ Validates health (zero errors, zero warnings)  
✅ Logs events for learning  
✅ Protection system verifies integrity

## ✨ What Makes CORTEX Revolutionary

<div class="technical-section">

### 🧠 **Persistent Memory**

Unlike stateless AI, CORTEX remembers:

- **Short-term**: Last 20 conversations (Tier 1)
- **Long-term**: Learned patterns from all history (Tier 2)
- **Context**: Project-wide intelligence and metrics (Tier 3)

### 📈 **Automatic Learning**

- Every action logged to event stream
- 50+ events or 24 hours → Automatic BRAIN update
- Knowledge graph grows smarter with use
- Pattern reinforcement from successful workflows

### 🛡️ **Quality Protection**

- Challenges risky proposals (e.g., "skip TDD")
- Provides data-driven alternatives
- Enforces Definition of Ready and Done
- Protects brain integrity (Rule #22)

### 🎯 **Context Awareness**

- Knows project structure and hot files
- Identifies co-modification patterns
- Provides proactive warnings
- Data-driven estimates (not guesses)

### 🔄 **Dual-Hemisphere Coordination**

- <span class="left-brain">LEFT</span> executes with precision
- <span class="right-brain">RIGHT</span> plans with intelligence
- Corpus Callosum ensures alignment
- 10+ specialist agents coordinate seamlessly
