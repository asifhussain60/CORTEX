# CORTEX - Cognitive Operating System

Welcome to **CORTEX**, a revolutionary cognitive framework that gives AI assistants like GitHub Copilot a persistent memory and context-aware intelligence.

## 🧠 What is CORTEX?

CORTEX is a **three-tier brain system** modeled after human cognitive architecture:

- **Tier 1 (Working Memory)**: Conversation history and immediate context
- **Tier 2 (Knowledge Graph)**: Learned patterns and relationships
- **Tier 3 (Context Intelligence)**: Development metrics and work patterns

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Universal Entry Point
Single command for all CORTEX interactions - no need to remember multiple prompts.

### 🧠 Dual-Hemisphere Architecture
- **Left Hemisphere**: Tactical execution (TDD, code implementation, testing)
- **Right Hemisphere**: Strategic planning (architecture, design, workflows)

### 🤖 10 Specialist Agents
Each agent is an expert in their domain, following SOLID principles.

### 🛡️ Protection System
- Confidence thresholds prevent bad decisions
- Anomaly detection catches drift
- Automatic rollback on errors

### 📊 Live Metrics
- Real-time conversation tracking
- Git commit correlation
- Build and test status
- Health monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to CORTEX
cd /Users/asifhussain/PROJECTS/CORTEX

# Use the universal entry point
#file:/Users/asifhussain/PROJECTS/CORTEX/prompts/user/cortex.md

## 🎓 The Story

CORTEX solves the "Intern with Amnesia" problem - GitHub Copilot is brilliant but forgets everything between conversations. CORTEX gives it:

1. **Memory** - Remembers what you did yesterday, last week, last month
2. **Learning** - Gets better with every interaction
3. **Context** - Understands your project, your patterns, your preferences
4. **Intelligence** - Makes smart decisions based on history
