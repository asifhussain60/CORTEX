Create a professional technical diagram showing the CORTEX AI Assistant architecture.

Style: Clean, modern, technical illustration with a cyberpunk aesthetic
Color Scheme: Deep blues, purples, and cyan highlights on dark background
Layout: Hierarchical diagram with clear layers

Main Elements:
1. **Top Layer (User Interface):**
   - User avatar interacting with chat interface
   - Natural language commands flowing in
   
2. **Brain Protection Layer (Tier 0):**
   - Glowing protective shield labeled "SKULL Protection"
   - Rules filtering incoming requests
   
3. **Agent Coordination Layer:**
   - Corpus Callosum router (glowing central hub)
   - Two hemispheres branching left and right:
     * Left: Logical agents (code, test, validate, review)
     * Right: Creative agents (architect, plan, document, govern)
   - Connection lines showing information flow
   
4. **Memory Layers:**
   - Tier 1: Working Memory (bright, active nodes)
   - Tier 2: Knowledge Graph (interconnected patterns)
   - Tier 3: Long-term Archive (fading into background)
   
5. **Output Layer:**
   - Coordinated response flowing back to user
   - Multiple agent contributions merging

Technical Details:
- Show data flow with animated-looking arrows
- Include subtle code snippets floating in background
- Add glowing nodes for active processes
- Use depth and layers to show hierarchy
- Include CORTEX logo/branding

Mood: Futuristic, intelligent, organized, powerful yet approachable
