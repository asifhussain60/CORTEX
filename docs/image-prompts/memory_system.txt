Create a visualization of CORTEX's 4-tier memory architecture.

Style: Layered architectural diagram with depth, neural network aesthetic
Color Scheme: Warm to cool gradient (top to bottom)

Layers from top to bottom:
1. **Tier 0: Brain Protection** (Red/Orange shield)
   - SKULL rules forming protective barrier
   - Filtering harmful operations
   
2. **Tier 1: Working Memory** (Bright yellow/gold)
   - Recent conversations as glowing nodes
   - Active connections showing relevance scores
   - Conversation indexing in action
   
3. **Tier 2: Knowledge Graph** (Blue/purple)
   - Pattern nodes interconnected
   - Learning pathways lighting up
   - Pattern confidence scores displayed
   
4. **Tier 3: Long-Term Archive** (Deep blue/black)
   - Historical data fading into darkness
   - Trend lines emerging from patterns
   - Compressed knowledge storage

Visual Elements:
- Show data flowing between tiers
- Highlight auto-injection of Tier 1 context into current request
- Show pattern learning from Tier 1 to Tier 2
- Include timeline indicators (hours → days → months)

Mood: Intelligent, organized, deep, memory-like
