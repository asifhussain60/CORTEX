# Test-Driven Development Cycle

## Overview

RED → GREEN → REFACTOR workflow

## Pipeline Flow

This diagram illustrates a multi-stage pipeline with the following stages:

- Write Failing Test
- Run Test Red
- Implement Code
- Run Test Green
- Refactor
- Repeat

Each stage processes data and passes results to the next stage in sequence.

## Business Value

- **Visibility:** Clear understanding of processing flow
- **Maintainability:** Easy to identify bottlenecks
- **Reliability:** Validation at each stage
- **Scalability:** Stages can be independently optimized
