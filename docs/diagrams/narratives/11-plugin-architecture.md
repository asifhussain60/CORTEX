# Plugin Architecture

## Overview

Zero-footprint plugin system

## Plugin Architecture

The plugin system enables extensibility without modifying core code:

- **Central Hub:** Plugin manager coordinates all plugins
- **Event Hooks:** Plugins respond to system events
- **Isolation:** Plugins run independently
- **Lifecycle:** Managed initialization, execution, and cleanup

## Example Plugins



## Benefits

- **Extensibility:** Add features without changing core
- **Maintainability:** Plugins are self-contained
- **Flexibility:** Enable/disable features dynamically
- **Testing:** Plugins tested in isolation
