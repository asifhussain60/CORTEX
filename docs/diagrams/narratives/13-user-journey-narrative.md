# CORTEX User Journey

This journey map traces a typical user's experience with CORTEX.

**Setup Phase:**
- Install CORTEX (one command: `python setup_cortex.py`)
- Configure (optional API keys, defaults work for most features)

**Usage Phase:**
- Ask Question (natural language, no special syntax required)
- Get Response (context-aware, informed by past conversations)

**Improvement Phase:**
- CORTEX learns from interactions (conversation capture)
- Responses improve over time (knowledge graph expansion)

The user experience is designed to be effortless - CORTEX handles complexity internally so users can focus on their work, not tool configuration.
