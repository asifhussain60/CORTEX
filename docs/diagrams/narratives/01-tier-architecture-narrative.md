# CORTEX Tier Architecture

This diagram illustrates CORTEX's four-tier memory architecture, inspired by human cognitive systems.

**Tier 0 (Entry Point)** serves as the validation gateway, ensuring all requests pass through brain protection rules before processing.

**Tier 1 (Working Memory)** maintains active context from recent conversations, enabling CORTEX to remember what you discussed minutes ago.

**Tier 2 (Knowledge Graph)** stores semantic relationships between concepts, files, and patterns learned from past interactions.

**Tier 3 (Long-term Storage)** archives historical conversations and decisions for future reference.

This layered approach balances speed (Tier 1 fast access) with depth (Tier 3 comprehensive history), mimicking how humans recall recent events quickly while searching deeper for older memories.
