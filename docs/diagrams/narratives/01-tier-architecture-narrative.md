# CORTEX 4-Tier Architecture

## Visual Narrative

CORTEX's cortex 4-tier architecture mimics human cognitive processing. Tier 0 provides immutable instincts (like breathing - you can't override it). Tier 1 holds working memory (what you're currently thinking about). Tier 2 stores long-term patterns (learned experiences). Tier 3 provides situational awareness (context about your environment). Tier 4 captures real-time activity (immediate sensory input). Together, they create a complete cognitive system that makes Copilot self-aware and continuously learning.

## Key Concepts

High-level 4-tier cognitive architecture

## Developer Impact

This visualization helps developers understand how CORTEX enhances their workflow with GitHub Copilot by providing:
- Clear mental models of complex systems
- Visual reference for feature capabilities
- Intuitive understanding of data flow and agent coordination
