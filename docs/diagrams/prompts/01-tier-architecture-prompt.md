## Typography & Labels

### Tier Headers (Large, Bold)
- "TIER 0: ENTRY POINT" - Red banner across top of each tier
- "TIER 1: WORKING MEMORY"
- "TIER 2: KNOWLEDGE GRAPH"
- "TIER 3: LONG-TERM STORAGE"

### Component Labels (Medium, Clear)
- Sans-serif font (Roboto/Inter style)
- White text on colored backgrounds for contrast
- Drop shadow for readability: 2px offset, 50% opacity black

### Flow Labels (Small, Descriptive)
- Arrow path labels in italic
- Positioned alongside arrows without obscuring connections
- Background: semi-transparent white for readability

### Branding
- "CORTEX" wordmark in top-left corner
- Subtitle: "4-Tier Cognitive Architecture" below logo
- Version indicator: "v3.0" in small text

## Technical Accuracy

### Tier 0 Requirements
- Must show "Brain Protection" shield as primary security element
- Display request validation checkpoint (gate/barrier visual)
- Indicate routing decision point (traffic director icon)

### Tier 1 Requirements
- Show active/transient nature (lighter, semi-transparent platform)
- Illustrate session-based context (multiple document icons in rotation)
- Represent fast-access memory (lightning bolt accent)

### Tier 2 Requirements
- Network topology must show interconnected nodes (minimum 5 nodes)
- Display relationship types: solid lines (strong), dashed (weak)
- Include pattern recognition visual (repeating geometric elements)

### Tier 3 Requirements
- Database cylinders must show stacked/layered structure
- Indicate persistence (lock icon, archive visual)
- Show large storage capacity (expanded platform base)

### Critical Elements
- All tiers MUST be connected with visible arrows
- Data flow MUST be bidirectional (except user input/output)
- Shield protection MUST overlap Tier 0 boundary
- Isometric perspective MUST maintain consistent 45° angle

## Style & Aesthetic
- **Design Language:** Modern technical illustration with isometric projection
- **Detail Level:** High detail - show internal components within each tier
- **Texture:** Glossy platforms with subtle reflections, blueprint grid background
- **Depth:** Full 3D isometric with shadows between layers (10px offset, 30% opacity)

## DALL-E Generation Instruction

**Primary Prompt:**
"Create a professional isometric technical diagram of a 4-tier software architecture system named CORTEX. Show four stacked horizontal platforms in perspective view: Tier 0 (red #ff6b6b) at top labeled 'Entry Point' with shield protection, Tier 1 (turquoise #4ecdc4) labeled 'Working Memory' with active document icons, Tier 2 (blue #45b7d1) labeled 'Knowledge Graph' with interconnected network nodes, and Tier 3 (green #96ceb4) at bottom labeled 'Long-term Storage' with database cylinders. Include bidirectional arrows connecting all tiers showing data flow. Add a golden shield (#ffd700) wrapping around the top tier for security. Use clean modern technical illustration style with subtle blueprint grid background. High contrast labels in dark charcoal (#2c3e50). Professional enterprise software visualization suitable for technical documentation."

**Refinement Prompt (if needed):**
"Enhance the isometric perspective to show clear depth between layers. Make the data flow arrows more prominent with gradient effects. Add CORTEX branding in top-left corner. Increase contrast between tier colors and ensure all component labels are clearly readable. Add subtle shadows between layers for better depth perception."
