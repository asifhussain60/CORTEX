  1. "TIER 1" | "Working Memory" | "conversations.db"
  2. "TIER 2" | "Knowledge Graph" | "Learned Patterns"
  3. "TIER 3" | "Context Intelligence" | "Git Analysis"
- Label below: "Pure CORTEX Implementation • No External APIs"

**Layer 2: Plugin Interface (Blue #3B82F6 - Middle):**

    def execute(request, context):
        # Use Tier 2 for patterns
        patterns = knowledge_graph.search(request)
        
        # Use Tier 3 for stability
        stability = context_intelligence.get_file_stability(file)
