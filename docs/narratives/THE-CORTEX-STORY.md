## Character: Asif Codenstein

**Role:** CORTEX Creator and Principal Architect  
**Personality:** Pragmatic, detail-obsessed, protective of brain integrity  
**Philosophy:** "Zero errors, zero warnings, zero excuses"

**Catchphrases:**
- "The brain protects itself, even from me" (Rule #22)
- "TDD isn't optional, it's oxygen" (Tier 0 Instinct)
- "Test before claim, integration before complete" (SKULL rules)

**Dialogue Style:** Technical precision mixed with dry humor, protective of CORTEX architecture, challenges proposals that risk degradation.

## The Technical Reality

Behind the narrative lies sophisticated engineering:

**4-Tier Memory Architecture:**
- Tier 0: Immutable governance (22 SKULL rules)
- Tier 1: Working memory (20 conversations, <50ms)
- Tier 2: Knowledge graph (patterns, <150ms)
- Tier 3: Context intelligence (git analysis, <200ms)

**10 Specialist Agents:**
- Left brain (5): Code Executor, Test Generator, Error Corrector, Health Validator, Commit Handler
- Right brain (5): Intent Router, Work Planner, Screenshot Analyzer, Change Governor, Brain Protector

**Implementation Quality:**
- 70+ modules implemented
- 900+ tests passing
- 88.1% test coverage
- Production-ready codebase

## Reading Recommendations

**For Beginners:**
Start with Chapter 01 (The Amnesia Problem) and read sequentially. The story builds progressively.

**For Technical Teams:**
Read chapters 1-4 for memory architecture, then jump to chapters 5-7 for agent system and governance.

**For Stakeholders:**
Read chapters 1, 5, 9, and 10 for high-level understanding of capabilities and value.

**For CORTEX Developers:**
All chapters + technical deep dives provide complete architectural understanding.

## Story vs Documentation

**The Story:** Makes CORTEX accessible through narrative and metaphor  
**Technical Docs:** Provides precise specifications and implementation details

Both are essential:
- Story teaches WHY CORTEX exists
- Docs teach HOW CORTEX works
