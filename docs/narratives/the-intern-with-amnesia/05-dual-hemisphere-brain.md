## Overview

**Concept:** Separating strategic memory from operational execution  
**Technical Mapping:** Left Hemisphere (Analysis) vs Right Hemisphere (Creativity)

## The Story

The brain you built isn't just a simple storage system—it's a sophisticated **dual-hemisphere cognitive architecture** modeled after the human brain itself. Just like your brain has specialized hemispheres that work together, CORTEX gives Copilot two distinct processing systems that coordinate seamlessly.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Left Hemisphere (Analysis) vs Right Hemisphere (Creativity)


**Dual-Hemisphere Architecture:**
- **Left Brain:** Tactical execution (code, tests, fixes)
- **Right Brain:** Strategic planning (architecture, patterns, protection)
- **Corpus Callosum:** Coordination bridge

**Left Hemisphere Agents:**
1. Code Executor - Precise implementation
2. Test Generator - TDD enforcement
3. Error Corrector - Mistake recovery
4. Health Validator - Quality gates
5. Commit Handler - Git operations

**Right Hemisphere Agents:**
1. Intent Router - Natural language processing
2. Work Planner - Strategic planning
3. Screenshot Analyzer - Visual requirements
4. Change Governor - Risk assessment
5. Brain Protector - Architectural integrity

## Key Takeaways

- Left brain handles tactical execution with precision
- Right brain manages strategic planning and patterns
- Corpus callosum coordinates hemispheric communication
- Specialization enables expert-level performance
