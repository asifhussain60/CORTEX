## Overview

**Concept:** Autonomous agents that operate independently  
**Technical Mapping:** Agent System (planning, execution, coordination)

## The Story

Like the human right brain (which handles creativity, holistic thinking, and pattern recognition), CORTEX's right hemisphere is **the strategic planner**—visionary, context-aware, and forward-thinking.

**What the Right Brain Does:**
- **Architecture Design** - Understands how all components fit together across the entire project
- **Strategic Planning** - Breaks big features into logical phases, estimates effort realistically, assesses risks proactively
- **Pattern Recognition** - Remembers "we've done something similar before—here's the template that worked"
- **Context Awareness** - Knows which files change together, what workflows typically succeed, where problems usually occur
- **Future Projection** - Warns about potentially risky changes before you make them
- **Brain Protection** - Guards the brain's own integrity against degradation (Rule #22)

**The Right Brain Specialist Agents:**

1. **The Dispatcher** (`intent-router`)
   - Interprets your natural language requests intelligently
   - Routes work to the appropriate specialist agent
   - Detects intent: PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, FIX, VALIDATE, ANALYZE, PROTECT
   - Handles ambiguous requests gracefully

2. **The Planner** (`work-planner`)
   - Creates multi-phase strategic implementation plans
   - Breaks phases into actionable tasks
   - Estimates effort and identifies risks
   - Defines clear success criteria

3. **The Analyst** (`screenshot-analyzer`)
   - Extracts requirements from screenshots and images
   - Identifies UI components and their properties
   - Converts visual designs into technical specifications
   - Bridges the gap between design and implementation

4. **The Governor** (`change-governor`)
   - Protects CORTEX from architectural degradation
   - Challenges risky proposals (especially to core systems)
   - Enforces separation between application code and CORTEX core
   - Prevents "creeping bloat" and scope drift

5. **The Brain Protector** (`brain-protector`)
   - Implements Rule #22: Challenge user changes to brain
   - Validates proposed changes against 6 protection layers
   - Suggests safer alternatives when risks detected
   - Maintains architectural integrity over time

## Technical Deep Dive

### Agent System (planning, execution, coordination)


**Agent System:**
- 10 specialist agents (5 left, 5 right)
- Message-based coordination via Corpus Callosum
- Autonomous decision-making within domain
- Cross-hemisphere collaboration
- Validation and acknowledgment protocol

**Coordination Protocol:**
1. Right brain creates strategic plan
2. Corpus callosum delivers tasks
3. Left brain executes with precision
4. Results feed back to right brain
5. Alignment validation continuous


---

## Key Takeaways

- 10 specialist agents operate autonomously
- Each agent has domain expertise and clear responsibilities
- Message-based coordination enables async collaboration
- Validation ensures alignment between strategy and execution
