## The Story

You've just hired an incredibly talented intern named **Copilot**. They're absolutely brilliant—can code fluently in any programming language, understand complex system architectures instantly, and work at lightning speed. They never get tired, never complain, and are always eager to help.

There's just one critical problem: **Copilot has amnesia**.

Every time you walk away, even for a quick coffee break, Copilot forgets everything. You said "make it purple" five minutes ago? Gone. The file you were just discussing? Vanished from memory. The architecture you carefully explained yesterday? As if it never happened. That bug you told them about this morning? No recollection.

Worse yet, Copilot has no memory between chat sessions. Start a new conversation? They don't remember the last one existed. Leave for lunch? When you return, it's like meeting them for the first time all over again. Every. Single. Time.

This would be absolutely catastrophic for any real project... **except you've done something revolutionary: you've built Copilot a brain**.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Introduction to Tier 1 Working Memory


**The Amnesia Problem:**
- GitHub Copilot has no persistent memory between sessions
- Context lost when switching files or starting new conversations
- No learning from past interactions
- "It" references become ambiguous
- Architecture decisions not remembered

**CORTEX Solution:**
- Tier 1 Working Memory stores last 20 conversations
- Entity tracking maintains context across messages
- Conversation continuity preserved
- Active protection prevents context loss


---

## Key Takeaways

- GitHub Copilot's amnesia is a critical problem for productive development
- Context loss occurs between sessions and file switches
- CORTEX solves this with persistent memory architecture
- Tier 1 Working Memory is the foundation
