# Operations Overview

**Generated**:   
**Version**: 

CORTEX 3.0 operations are organized around Entry Point Modules (EPMs) for major tasks and agent workflows for routine operations.

## Entry Point Modules (EPMs)

EPMs provide the primary interface for administrative and maintenance operations. These are destructive, high-impact operations that admins run after major changes.



## Agent Operations

Agent operations are the day-to-day workflows that handle user requests.

### Right Brain Operations

**Strategic agents** handle intent routing and planning:



### Left Brain Operations

**Tactical agents** handle execution and validation:



## Operation Workflows

### Conversation Handling

![Conversation Flow](../images/diagrams/operational/conversation-flow.md)

1. **Intent Capture**: User message received
2. **Context Enrichment**: Load relevant tier data
3. **Agent Routing**: Route to appropriate agent
4. **Execution**: Agent performs task
5. **Response Generation**: Format and return response

### Knowledge Graph Update

![Knowledge Graph Update](../images/diagrams/operational/knowledge-graph-update.md)

1. **Pattern Detection**: Identify recurring patterns
2. **Relationship Extraction**: Extract file relationships
3. **Graph Update**: Update knowledge graph
4. **Validation**: Verify graph consistency

### Health Monitoring

![Health Check](../images/diagrams/operational/health-check.md)

1. **Metric Collection**: Gather system metrics
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Compare against baselines
3. **Alert Generation**: Generate alerts if needed
4. **Auto-remediation**: Attempt automatic fixes

## Safety and Governance

### Brain Protection

All operations that modify the cortex-brain are subject to protection rules:

1. **Pre-flight validation**: Check against rules
2. **Approval required**: Explicit user confirmation
3. **Backup creation**: Automatic backup
4. **Rollback capability**: Restore on failure

### Audit Trail

All operations are logged for audit purposes:

- **Operation type**: What was executed
- **Timestamp**: When it occurred
- **User**: Who initiated it
- **Result**: Success/failure
- **Changes**: What was modified

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

Run health checks to verify system status:

```bash
python -m src.epm.health_check
```

### Metrics

CORTEX tracks key metrics:

- Operation latency
- Agent utilization
- Error rates
- Knowledge graph size
- Conversation volume

### Logs

Logs are organized by component:

- `logs/operations/`: Operation logs
- `logs/agents/`: Agent execution logs
- `logs/health/`: Health check logs
- `logs/errors/`: Error logs

## Best Practices

1. **Use EPMs for major changes**: Run documentation generator after significant updates
2. **Monitor health regularly**: Set up periodic health checks
3. **Review audit logs**: Check logs for anomalies
4. **Keep brain backed up**: EPMs create backups, but manual backups are recommended
5. **Test in dry-run mode**: Use `--dry-run` flag to preview changes
