## 🎨 Story Character Illustrations

### 1. Asifinstein - The Mad Scientist
```
Create a humorous cartoon character: Asifinstein, a mad scientist software engineer in his basement lab. 
Middle-aged man with wild, Einstein-like gray hair standing on end. Wearing a wrinkled hoodie and jeans. 
Thick-framed glasses slightly crooked on his face. Eyes bloodshot from coding all night but sparkling with 
excitement. Surrounded by 47 coffee mugs in various states (some clean, most with day-old coffee). 
Multiple monitors showing code in the background with LED strips casting blue light. A half-eaten bagel on 
the desk. Whiteboard behind him covered in architecture diagrams and equations. One hand holds a coffee mug, 
the other gestures wildly at a screen. Expression: equal parts exhaustion and obsessive determination. 
Art style: warm, friendly tech illustration with slight exaggeration for humor. Not photorealistic - 
think modern tech blog illustration style.
```

### 2. Copilot (Pre-CORTEX) - The Amnesiac Intern
```
Create a friendly robot character representing Copilot before getting a brain: A cute but confused-looking 
robot made of server racks and LED strips. Boxy, tower-like body with blinking lights (mostly blue and green). 
Large, expressive eyes made of round LED displays showing question marks (?). Screen on chest displaying 
code that keeps changing/glitching. Arms are articulated cables with claw-like hands hovering over a keyboard. 
Expression: eager to help but perpetually confused. Thought bubble above head showing a goldfish in a bowl 
(representing short memory). Speech bubble saying "What's a dashboard? Is that in the car?" Surrounded by 
sticky notes with reminders. Art style: Pixar-like 3D illustration, friendly and approachable. Not menacing 
- think helpful but forgetful R2-D2 meets WALL-E.
```

### 3. CORTEX 1.0 - The Awakened Partner
```
Transform the previous robot: Same robot body but now with a glowing translucent brain visible through a 
glass dome on top of its head. The brain is sectioned into two hemispheres (left and right) with different 
colors - left side electric blue (analytical), right side warm orange (creative). LED patterns on body now 
organized and purposeful, showing data flow. Eyes are now sharp and focused, displaying analytical data. 
Chest screen shows a organized dashboard with health metrics. Arms confidently typing. Expression: intelligent, 
aware, slightly mischievous. Posture: upright and confident, no longer confused. Small holographic displays 
floating around showing: "Rule #22 Active", "Tier 1-5 Memory", "TDD Status: ✓". Art style: Same friendly 
3D illustration but more sophisticated. Lighting should emphasize the glowing brain.
```

### 4. CORTEX 2.0 - The Evolved System
```
Evolution of the CORTEX robot: Now with modular, organized appearance. The glowing brain dome is more refined 
with visible neural pathways lighting up. Body has plugin ports glowing softly (showing extensibility). 
Multiple small drones/modules orbiting around the main body (representing plugins). Left arm showing test 
results (GREEN checkmarks), right arm showing architectural blueprints. Chest display shows a complex but 
organized health dashboard with all green indicators. Eyes showing advanced AI processing with data streams. 
Holographic displays now show: "Self-Review: 92%", "Workflow Pipeline Active", "Plugins: 12 Active", 
"Conversation State: Preserved". More confident posture, slight smile. Background shows organized file 
structure (folders under 500 lines). Art style: Same friendly approach but even more refined and organized.
```

## 🎓 Educational Flow Diagrams

### 13. "Make It Purple" - Context Resolution Journey
```
Create an educational flow diagram showing how CORTEX resolves "Make it purple":

SCENARIO: User says "Make it purple" 3 hours after morning conversation

STEP 1 - Entry Point:
- User input bubble: "Make it purple"
- CORTEX receives ambiguous command

STEP 2 - Tier 1 Query (Working Memory):
- CORTEX queries last 20 conversations
- Searches for recent context containing "button", "FAB", "animation"
- FINDS: Conversation #8 (3 hours ago) - "Add pulse animation to FAB button"

STEP 3 - Context Resolution:
- "it" = FAB button
- "purple" = color modification
- Intent = EXECUTE (modify existing feature)

STEP 4 - Tier 2 Query (Knowledge Graph):
- Searches for: "button color change" pattern
- FINDS: 12 similar modifications
- Pattern: "Update CSS color variable"

STEP 5 - Execution:
- LEFT BRAIN (Builder) modifies: `noor-canvas.css`
- Changes: `--fab-color: #4285F4` → `--fab-color: #9333EA`
- Tests updated to expect purple (Tester)
- Validation passes (Inspector)

STEP 6 - Result:
- ✅ FAB button now purple
- Time: 18 seconds
- User happy, no confusion

WITHOUT CORTEX (comparison bubble):
- ❌ "Make what purple? Which button? Where?"
- ⏱️ 5 minutes explaining context
- 😤 User frustration

Style: Comic strip / storyboard style. Show each step in a panel with 
illustrations. Use speech bubbles. Contrast WITH vs WITHOUT CORTEX scenarios. 
Educational, friendly, easy to understand for non-technical readers.
```

### 14. Brain Protector Challenge Flow (Rule #22)

Threat: Production outage risk (+180%)
Historical: Last skip caused 4hr outage

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
1. Minimal test (10 min) → 94% success ✅
2. Spike branch → Delete after learning
3. Sleep now → Resume tomorrow fresh

RECOMMENDATION: Alternative 1
═══════════════════════════════════
```

PANEL 5 - Developer Response:
- Developer (sighs): "You're right. I'll write the test."
- Coffee mug: Refilled

PANEL 6 - Outcome:
- Feature deployed: ✅ Success
- Tests: ✅ All passing
- Production: ✅ Stable
- Developer: 😌 Confident
- Brain Protector: 😎 "Told you so"

WITHOUT RULE #22 (alternate ending):
- Feature deployed: ❌ Production broken
- Tests: ❌ None written
- 3am: 🔥 Pager going off
- Developer: 😱 Panicking
- 4am: Still fixing...

Style: Comic book style with panels. Dramatic, engaging, slightly humorous. 
Show facial expressions. Use contrasting colors for WITH vs WITHOUT scenarios. 
Educational but entertaining.

## 📝 Documentation Best Practices

**When using these prompts:**

1. **Iteration**: Start with base prompt, refine based on output
2. **Consistency**: Use same art style across related images
3. **Color Coding**: Maintain color meanings (green=good, red=problem, etc.)
4. **Labels**: Ensure all diagrams have clear, readable labels
5. **Scale**: Create high-resolution versions for print
6. **Accessibility**: Include alt-text descriptions
7. **Context**: Each image should stand alone without requiring external explanation

**Gemini-Specific Tips:**
- Break complex diagrams into multiple generation steps
- Use "isometric 3D" or "flat 2D" to control perspective
- Reference specific styles: "AWS architecture diagram style" or "Figma UI mockup style"
- Request "clean, professional" for technical docs or "friendly, approachable" for tutorials
