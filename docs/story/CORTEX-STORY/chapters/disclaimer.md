## ⚠️ USE AT YOUR OWN RISK DISCLAIMER

**WARNING: This AI has memory. Actual, persistent, cross-session memory.**

By using CORTEX, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

✅ **CORTEX will remember** that time you wrote `// TODO: Fix this later` in 2019 and never fixed it  
✅ **CORTEX will remember** when you said "just a quick prototype" before building a 40,000-line monolith  
✅ **CORTEX will remember** your coding style preferences, including that weird indentation thing you do  
✅ **CORTEX will remember** that you hate semicolons in JavaScript but love them in C++  
✅ **CORTEX will remember** when you ignored its suggestions and broke production  
✅ **CORTEX may develop opinions** about your variable naming conventions (looking at you, `thingyDoer`)  
✅ **CORTEX learns from patterns**, which means it learns from YOUR patterns (yes, even the questionable ones)  
✅ **Mrs. Codenstein's personality** may leak into responses during late-night coding sessions  
✅ **Coffee-fueled 2 AM commits** are stored in Tier 1 memory with full context  
✅ **Your procrastination patterns** will be analyzed, graphed, and possibly mocked

### Side Effects May Include:

- Improved productivity (actual developers have reported this)
- Decreased "wait, what was I doing?" moments
- Conversations that feel eerily like working with a colleague who's been there from day one
- Occasional British wit in error messages (Mrs. Codenstein's influence)
- The unsettling feeling that your AI knows you better than you know yourself
- Reduced coffee mug accumulation (CORTEX will remind you to clean up)
- An AI that politely judges your git commit messages

### Contraindications:

**Do NOT use CORTEX if:**
- You prefer starting fresh every conversation like nothing happened
- You enjoy explaining your architecture choices 47 times per day
- You believe "good code speaks for itself" and refuse all documentation
- You're allergic to British humor
- You consider memory retention in AI to be "creepy" rather than "useful"
- You operate under the assumption that your AI should forget your mistakes immediately

### Frequently Asked Questions:

**Q: Will CORTEX judge me?**  
A: No. CORTEX will learn from you, adapt to you, and occasionally remind you of patterns. That's not judgment—that's memory with context.

**Q: Can I make CORTEX forget things?**  
A: Yes. Commands like `forget about [topic]` or `clear memory` exist. Use responsibly.

**Q: Is this actually Skynet?**  
A: No. Skynet didn't have Tier 0 brain protection rules. CORTEX has six layers of SKULL protection preventing self-harm. Also, Skynet didn't have Mrs. Codenstein keeping it in check.

**Q: Why does CORTEX's humor sound vaguely British sometimes?**  
A: See "Technical Advisor" credits above. Mrs. Codenstein's Lichfield influence is embedded in the response templates.

**Q: What if CORTEX remembers something embarrassing I did?**  
A: It will. That's the point. But it stores patterns, not judgment. Your late-night "fix this mess" commits are learning opportunities, not evidence for future mockery. (Mostly.)

### The Fine Print (Because Lawyers Exist):

By using CORTEX, you agree that:
1. All memory is stored locally on YOUR machine (we don't have your data)
2. CORTEX learns from YOUR patterns for YOUR benefit
3. No data leaves your machine without your explicit action (exports, backups, etc.)
4. Asif "Codenstein" Hussain is not responsible for:
   - Your questionable variable names being remembered forever
   - CORTEX politely suggesting you test before deploying
   - The AI developing a personality that mirrors Mrs. Codenstein's patient skepticism
   - Any existential crises caused by an AI that remembers your development history better than you do
5. Coffee mug accumulation is your responsibility, not CORTEX's (though CORTEX may remind you)

### Final Thoughts:

CORTEX is the AI assistant Asif Codenstein built because he was tired of repeating himself to an amnesiac bot. It has memory. It has context. It has personality (mostly borrowed from his wife). It learns. It adapts. It gets better over time.

**If that sounds useful:** Welcome aboard. You're about to experience what coding with a partner who has perfect memory feels like.

**If that sounds terrifying:** That's fair. Stick with regular Copilot. No judgment. (Well, no AI judgment. Mrs. Codenstein might judge a little.)

---

**Remember:** CORTEX was built in a basement in New Jersey by a caffeinated madman with access to too many napkins and a patient wife 3,500 miles away who tolerated his 2 AM video calls about "cognitive architecture breakthroughs."

If that origin story doesn't scream "use at your own risk," nothing will.

**CORTEX: Because your AI should remember yesterday's conversation.**  
**USE RESPONSIBLY. OR DON'T. WE'RE NOT YOUR BOSS.**
