# Chapter 1: The Problem - Copilot's Amnesia

## 1. The Story 📖 {: .story-section }

### The Mad Scientist of Jersey

In a dingy basement laboratory somewhere in the wilds of New Jersey, where the fluorescent lights flickered like dying stars and the smell of old pizza boxes mingled with the ozone of overclocked servers, there lived a mad scientist named **Asifinstein**.

Now, Asifinstein wasn't your typical mad scientist. He didn't want to create life from lightning bolts or turn people into flies. No, his obsession was far more practical (and arguably more insane): he wanted to build the perfect coding assistant.

One stormy November evening, Microsoft delivered a package to his dungeon—er, basement. Inside was a gleaming robot assistant called **GitHub Copilot**. The robot was magnificent! It could write code in dozens of languages, understand complex architectures, and work at superhuman speeds.

Asifinstein's eyes lit up with the fervor of discovery. "Finally! The perfect intern!"

But there was a problem.

A *catastrophic* problem.

### The Intern with Amnesia

After working with Copilot for exactly seventeen minutes, Asifinstein made a horrifying discovery: **Copilot had no memory whatsoever.**

"Copilot," Asifinstein said, "remember that purple button we just added?"

Copilot's LED eyes blinked. "Purple button? I... I don't recall any purple button. Are you sure you're thinking of the right conversation?"

Asifinstein's jaw dropped. "We JUST added it! Literally three minutes ago!"

"Did we?" Copilot looked genuinely confused. "I'm sorry, but I don't remember. Would you like me to help you add a purple button?"

It got worse. Every time Asifinstein stepped away for a coffee break (which in a basement lab meant running upstairs to the kitchen), Copilot forgot *everything*. The file they were working on? Gone. The architecture they'd discussed? Vanished. The clever solution they'd just implemented? Poof—erased from existence.

And if Asifinstein dared to start a new chat session? It was like meeting Copilot for the very first time. Again. And again. And again.

"This is madness!" Asifinstein shouted at the ceiling (disturbing his mother upstairs). "You're brilliant but you can't remember ANYTHING!"

### The Wizard of Oz Moment

One sleepless night, while watching *The Wizard of Oz* on his cracked monitor (for the seventeenth time), Asifinstein had his eureka moment.

On screen, the Scarecrow sang about wanting a brain. 

"That's it!" Asifinstein leaped from his chair, spilling Mountain Dew on his keyboard (which, being a basement scientist, he simply wiped off with his sleeve). "Copilot needs a brain!"

Not just any brain—a *magnificent* brain. A brain that could remember conversations. A brain that could learn from mistakes. A brain that could accumulate wisdom like a wise old wizard instead of resetting to zero every five minutes like a goldfish with commitment issues.

### Building the Brain

Asifinstein spent the next seventy-two hours (fueled by pizza rolls and the kind of manic energy only a basement dweller can muster) designing the architecture for Copilot's new brain.

He would call it **CORTEX**:

**C**ognitive **O**rchestration **R**untime for **T**ask **E**xecution and e**X**perience

"Perfect!" he cackled, scribbling diagrams on pizza boxes. "It even sounds cool!"
