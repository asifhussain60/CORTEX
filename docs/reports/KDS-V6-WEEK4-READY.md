## 🎯 Your Mission

Build the **final brain capability**: continuous learning that makes the brain fully autonomous and self-improving.

### What You'll Build (7 Phases)

```
Phase 1: Learning Pipeline (3-4 hrs)
  → Automatic pattern extraction from events
  
Phase 2: Left→Right Feedback (2-3 hrs)
  → Left brain sends metrics to right brain
  
Phase 3: Right→Left Optimization (2-3 hrs)
  → Right brain creates better plans from metrics
  
Phase 4: Continuous Learning (2-3 hrs)
  → Learning runs automatically after tasks
  
Phase 5: Proactive Intelligence (2-3 hrs)
  → Brain predicts and warns about issues
  
Phase 6: Performance Monitoring (1-2 hrs)
  → Brain tracks its own efficiency
  
Phase 7: E2E Acceptance Test (2-3 hrs)
  → Validate entire brain with complex feature
```

**Total Time:** ~15-20 hours

## 🚀 How to Start

### Step 1: Verify Foundation
```powershell
# Make sure Weeks 1-3 are 100%
.\tests\v6-progressive\week1-validation.ps1
.\tests\v6-progressive\week2-validation.ps1
.\tests\v6-progressive\week3-validation.ps1

# Check Week 4 baseline
.\tests\v6-progressive\week4-validation.ps1  # Should show 10/50 (20%)
```

### Step 2: Begin Phase 1
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md

Implement Phase 1 of Week 4: Learning Pipeline

Create these 4 scripts with TDD:
1. extract-patterns-from-events.ps1
2. calculate-pattern-confidence.ps1
3. merge-patterns.ps1
4. update-knowledge-graph-learning.ps1

Goal: Group 1 tests passing (8/8)
```

### Step 3: Continue Through Phases
Use the same TDD workflow for each phase until all 50 tests pass.

### Step 4: Run E2E Test
```powershell
.\tests\e2e\brain-acceptance-test.ps1 -Verbose
```

If E2E passes: **🧠 BRAIN IS FULLY INTELLIGENT! 🎉**

## 💡 The Progressive Journey

### How We Got Here

```
Week 1: Created hemisphere structure
  ↓
  Hemispheres can coordinate via corpus callosum
  
Week 2: Left brain learned TDD automation
  ↓
  Automatic RED→GREEN→REFACTOR cycle
  
Week 3: Right brain learned pattern matching
  ↓
  Using Week 2's TDD to build itself!
  
Week 4: Brain builds continuous learning
  ↓
  Using ALL previous capabilities!
  
Result: FULLY AUTONOMOUS BRAIN 🧠
```

### The Meta-Achievement

**The brain progressively built itself!**

Each week's capabilities were used to build the next week's capabilities. Now in Week 4, the brain uses everything it learned in Weeks 1-3 to build its final capability: **continuous self-improvement**.

## 🎉 What Happens After Week 4

When Week 4 is complete, the brain will:

1. **Learn from Every Execution**
   - Automatic pattern extraction
   - Knowledge graph updated continuously
   - Gets smarter with use

2. **Optimize Continuously**
   - Left and right hemispheres teach each other
   - Plans improve based on execution data
   - Efficiency increases over time

3. **Predict Proactively**
   - Warns about issues before they occur
   - Suggests preventive actions
   - Reduces errors and rework

4. **Monitor Performance**
   - Tracks its own efficiency
   - Identifies bottlenecks
   - Self-optimizes

5. **Operate Autonomously**
   - Handles complex novel features
   - No manual intervention needed
   - Production-ready

**All future work automatically benefits from the brain's intelligence!** 🚀
