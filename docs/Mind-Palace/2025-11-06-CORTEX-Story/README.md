## 📚 The CORTEX Chronicle

**The Story of Dr. Asifinstein and the Machine That Thinks**

In a laboratory where code and consciousness intersect, a brilliant scientist named Dr. Asifinstein faced a problem: GitHub Copilot, despite its genius, had no memory. Every conversation was a blank slate. Every suggestion forgotten moments after creation.

So Dr. Asifinstein did what great scientists do—he built a solution. Not just a tool, but a cognitive architecture that could remember, learn, and evolve. He called it **CORTEX: Cerebral Orchestration and Runtime Task EXecution**.

This is the story of that creation, told through chapters that blend narrative, visual imagination, and technical precision.
