Tier 0: Smart Cleanup Hook (skeleton)

Purpose:
- Enforce CORTEX folder structure hygiene
- Auto-archive safe docs to Git (per Rule PHASE_GIT_CHECKPOINT & Rule #23 design)
- Require approval for potentially breaking moves/archives

Note: This is a skeleton; full implementation will be completed in later phases.
