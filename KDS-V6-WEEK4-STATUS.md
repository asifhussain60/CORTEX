**Status:** 🎯 Week 4 Setup Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Progress:** 10/50 tests passing (20% baseline)

---

## ✅ What's Complete

### Weeks 1-3 Foundation (100%)
- ✅ **Week 1:** Brain hemisphere structure and coordination queue (100%)
- ✅ **Week 2:** Left brain TDD automation (RED→GREEN→REFACTOR) (100%)
- ✅ **Week 3:** Right brain pattern matching and workflow templates (100%)

### Week 4 Setup (Phase 0 Complete)
- ✅ Week 4 implementation plan created
- ✅ Week 4 validation test suite created (50 tests)
- ✅ E2E acceptance test defined
- ✅ Quick reference guide created
- ✅ Baseline established: 10/50 tests (20%)

---

## 📊 Week 4 Overview

### Goal
Build the **final brain capability**: continuous learning from execution with cross-hemisphere feedback loops, then validate the entire brain with an E2E acceptance test.

### 7 Implementation Phases

| Phase | Description | Duration | Tests | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|--------|
| 0 | Test Infrastructure | 30 min | - | ✅ COMPLETE |
| 1 | Learning Pipeline | 3-4 hrs | 8 | ⏳ NEXT |
| 2 | Left→Right Feedback | 2-3 hrs | 7 | 📋 PLANNED |
| 3 | Right→Left Optimization | 2-3 hrs | 7 | 📋 PLANNED |
| 4 | Continuous Learning | 2-3 hrs | 6 | 📋 PLANNED |
| 5 | Proactive Intelligence | 2-3 hrs | 7 | 📋 PLANNED |
| 6 | Performance Monitoring | 1-2 hrs | 5 | 📋 PLANNED |
| 7 | E2E Acceptance Test | 2-3 hrs | 10 | 📋 PLANNED |
| **TOTAL** | | **~15-20 hrs** | **50** | **20%** |

## 🎯 Week 4 Capabilities

When Week 4 is complete, the brain will:

1. **Learn Automatically** - Extract patterns from every execution
2. **Optimize Continuously** - Left and right hemispheres teach each other
3. **Predict Proactively** - Warn about issues before they occur
4. **Monitor Performance** - Track its own efficiency
5. **Validate Itself** - E2E test proves it can handle complex novel features

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Check Current Status
```powershell
# Verify foundation complete
.\tests\v6-progressive\week1-validation.ps1  # Should be 100%
.\tests\v6-progressive\week2-validation.ps1  # Should be 100%
.\tests\v6-progressive\week3-validation.ps1  # Should be 100%

# Check Week 4 baseline
.\tests\v6-progressive\week4-validation.ps1  # Currently 20%
```

### Begin Phase 1
```markdown
#file:KDS/prompts/user/kds.md

Implement Phase 1 of Week 4: Learning Pipeline

Use TDD to create:
1. extract-patterns-from-events.ps1
2. calculate-pattern-confidence.ps1
3. merge-patterns.ps1
4. update-knowledge-graph-learning.ps1

Goal: Group 1 tests passing (8/8)
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Week 4 is complete when:

- [ ] All 50 Week 4 tests passing (100%)
- [ ] Learning pipeline automated
- [ ] Feedback loops working (left→right, right→left)
- [ ] Continuous learning active
- [ ] Proactive intelligence warning users
- [ ] Performance monitoring tracking metrics
- [ ] E2E acceptance test passes (<90 min for complex feature)

If all criteria met:

**🧠 BRAIN IS FULLY INTELLIGENT AND PRODUCTION-READY! 🎉**

## 💡 Progressive Intelligence Achievement

### The Journey

```
Week 1: Created brain structure
  ↓
Week 2: Left brain learned TDD
  ↓
Week 3: Right brain learned patterns (using Week 2's TDD!)
  ↓
Week 4: Brain learns from execution (using ALL capabilities!)
  ↓
FULLY AUTONOMOUS BRAIN 🧠
```

### The Meta-Achievement

**The brain progressively built itself, using each week's capabilities to build the next week's capabilities!**

Now in Week 4, we validate that the brain can:
- Handle complex novel features
- Learn from every execution
- Optimize itself continuously
- Predict issues proactively
- Operate fully autonomously

---

**Next:** Begin Phase 1 - Learning Pipeline Implementation  
**Timeline:** ~15-20 hours total  
**End Goal:** 50/50 tests + E2E validation passes

---

**Let's complete the brain! 🚀**
