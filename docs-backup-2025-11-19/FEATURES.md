## Overview

CORTEX is a multi-tier AI development assistant with persistent memory, intelligent context management, and natural language operations.

## Core Features

### Memory & Context

<div class="feature-list">

- **4-Tier Memory Architecture:** Working memory, knowledge graph, context intelligence, and long-term storage
- **Automatic Context Injection:** Relevant past conversations auto-loaded based on keywords, files, and intent
- **Semantic Search:** Find related discussions using natural language queries
- **Conversation Scoring:** Relevance algorithms prioritize most useful context (0.0-1.0 confidence)
- **Cross-Session Continuity:** Maintain context across days, files, and projects
- **Entity Extraction:** Automatic identification of classes, functions, patterns from conversations

</div>

### Documentation Generation

<div class="feature-list">

- **Enterprise Documentation Orchestrator:** One-command comprehensive docs generation
- **Mermaid Diagram Generation:** Architecture, workflow, and dependency diagrams from YAML
- **Story Generation:** "The Awakening of CORTEX" narrative with chapter structure
- **MkDocs Integration:** Automated site build with custom Tales dark theme
- **Cross-Reference Links:** Automatic linking between related documentation pages
- **Live Brain Sources:** Documentation generated from actual CORTEX brain data (no placeholders)

</div>

### Code Analysis

<div class="feature-list">

- **Codebase Crawler:** Systematic scanning of source files, dependencies, API endpoints
- **Dependency Graph:** Visual representation of module relationships and import chains
- **Architecture Discovery:** Automatic identification of patterns, anti-patterns, tech stack
- **File Relationship Mapping:** Track which files depend on each other
- **Health Monitoring:** Continuous validation of code quality, test coverage, performance
- **Integration Detection:** Identify API contracts, external services, database schemas

</div>

### Natural Language Interface

<div class="feature-list">

- **Zero Commands:** No slash commands or syntax to memorize - just natural language
- **Intent Detection:** Automatic routing to appropriate agent (PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, etc.)
- **Template-Based Responses:** Pre-formatted responses for common operations
- **Context-Aware Replies:** Response style adapts to work type (feature, debug, docs)
- **Multi-Turn Conversations:** Maintain conversation state across multiple interactions
- **Question Clarification:** Interactive Q&A for feature planning and requirements

</div>

### Testing & Validation

<div class="feature-list">

- **TDD Enforcement:** Test-first development required by Tier 0 instinct
- **SKULL Rules:** 7 protection rules preventing common testing mistakes
- **834/897 Tests Passing:** 100% pass rate for non-skipped tests (93% overall)
- **Three-Tier Test Strategy:** BLOCKING (fix immediately), WARNING (skip with reason), PRAGMATIC (adjust thresholds)
- **Performance Budgets:** Reality-based thresholds for file sizes, load times, execution speed
- **Integration Testing:** End-to-end workflow validation across all tiers

</div>

### Security & Governance

<div class="feature-list">

- **Brain Protection System:** 10 layers with 27 automated rules
- **Tier 0 Instinct:** 19 immutable rules that cannot be bypassed
- **SOLID Principles:** Automated enforcement of design principles
- **Git Isolation:** Separate CORTEX data from user application code
- **Privacy First:** All data stays local, no cloud sync, no telemetry
- **Commit Validation:** Pre-commit hooks validate quality before push

</div>

### Operations & Workflows

<div class="feature-list">

- **24 Operations Available:** Setup, maintenance, documentation, planning, deployment
- **Plugin System:** Extensible architecture with zero external dependencies
- **Work Planner:** Interactive feature planning with DoR/DoD/Acceptance Criteria
- **Design Sync:** Automatic synchronization between design docs and implementation
- **Health Diagnostics:** Comprehensive system validation and optimization
- **Cleanup Orchestrator:** Automated workspace cleanup with safety rules

</div>
