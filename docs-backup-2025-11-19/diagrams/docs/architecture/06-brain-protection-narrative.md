# CORTEX Brain Protection (SKULL Rules)

This diagram illustrates CORTEX's governance system that prevents self-harm.

**Request** enters through the validation gateway before any processing occurs.

**Brain Protection** evaluates against SKULL rules (Seven Key Universal Logic Locks):
- No self-deletion of brain files
- No recursive operations that corrupt memory
- No breaking changes without validation
- No bypassing safety checks
- No unconstrained loops or expansions

**Pass** allows the request to proceed to execution.

**Fail** blocks the request and returns an explanation of why it violated protection rules.

This is CORTEX's equivalent of biological safety mechanisms - an AI can't improve if it accidentally destroys its own memory.
