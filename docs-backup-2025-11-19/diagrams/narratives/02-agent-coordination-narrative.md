# CORTEX Agent Coordination

This diagram shows CORTEX's split-brain agent system, inspired by neurological hemispheric specialization.

**Corpus Callosum (Router)** analyzes requests and routes them to the appropriate hemisphere based on task type.

**Left Hemisphere (Execution)** handles logical, sequential tasks: Executor (implements code), Tester (validates), Validator (checks quality).

**Right Hemisphere (Strategic)** manages creative, holistic tasks: Architect (designs systems), Planner (organizes work), Documenter (explains concepts).

This division mirrors human cognition where left-brain handles logic and right-brain handles creativity, enabling CORTEX to excel at both implementation and design.
