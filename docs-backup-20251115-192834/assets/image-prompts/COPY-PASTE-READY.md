Create a professional technical diagram illustrating a token optimization system with the following specifications:

**Layout:** Horizontal flow from left to right, split into three main sections with a results banner at bottom

**COLOR PALETTE:**
- Background: Clean white (#FFFFFF)
- Primary blue: #0066CC (headers, borders)
- Success green: #28A745 (optimized results)
- Warning red: #DC3545 (original bloated state)
- Accent purple: #6F42C1 (optimization engine)
- Light gray: #F8F9FA (section backgrounds)
- Dark text: #212529

**SECTION 1 - LEFT: "BEFORE OPTIMIZATION" (Warning Red Theme)**
Large box with red warning border (3px solid)
- Icon: ⚠️ Warning triangle at top
- Title: "BEFORE OPTIMIZATION" in bold caps
- Subtitle: "Monolithic Architecture"

Content inside box (vertically aligned):
1. File icon with text: "cortex-monolithic.md"
2. Large metric display in red highlight:
   ```
   74,047 TOKENS
   ↓
   $2.22 per request
   ```
3. Problems list (red bullet points):
   - "8,701 lines loaded every time"
   - "2-3 seconds to parse"
   - "Difficult to maintain"
   - "97% unnecessary content"

**SECTION 2 - CENTER: "OPTIMIZATION ENGINE" (Purple Theme)**
Hexagonal shape with gradient purple fill
- Icon: ⚙️ Gear icon with rotation effect
- Title: "TOKEN OPTIMIZER" in bold

Four optimization techniques stacked vertically with icons:
1. 📦 "Modular Architecture" - Sub-text: "Load only what's needed"
2. 🧠 "ML Context Compression" - Sub-text: "TF-IDF relevance scoring"
3. 📊 "Cache Management" - Sub-text: "Prevent explosion (50k limit)"
4. 🎯 "Smart Context Selection" - Sub-text: "Intent-based routing"

Arrow labels flowing through:
- Top arrow (BEFORE to ENGINE): "74,047 tokens" in red
- Bottom arrow (ENGINE to AFTER): "2,078 tokens" in green

**SECTION 3 - RIGHT: "AFTER OPTIMIZATION" (Success Green Theme)**
Large box with green success border (3px solid)
- Icon: ✅ Checkmark at top
- Title: "AFTER OPTIMIZATION" in bold caps
- Subtitle: "Modular Architecture"

Content inside box (vertically aligned):
1. File icon with folder symbol: "8 focused modules"
2. Large metric display in green highlight:
   ```
   2,078 TOKENS
   ↓
   $0.06 per request
   ```
3. Benefits list (green bullet points):
   - "200-400 lines per module"
   - "80ms to parse (97% faster)"
   - "Easy to maintain"
   - "Load only relevant content"

**BOTTOM SECTION: "THE RESULTS" (Blue accent)**
Full-width results banner with light blue background

Three metric cards displayed side-by-side:

Card 1: Token Reduction
```
97.2% REDUCTION
74,047 → 2,078 tokens
```

Card 2: Cost Savings
```
$25,920/year saved
1,000 requests/month
```

Card 3: Performance
```
97% FASTER
2.3s → 80ms load time
```

**VISUAL ELEMENTS:**
- Use arrows with animated dashed lines to show flow
- Add subtle drop shadows to boxes (2px blur, 10% opacity)
- Use rounded corners (8px radius) for all boxes
- Include small token "coin" icons (💎) next to token numbers
- Add small clock icons (⏱️) next to timing metrics
- Use badge-style labels for status indicators

**TYPOGRAPHY:**
- Headers: Bold, 18pt, Sans-serif
- Metrics: Bold, 24pt, Monospace font
- Body text: Regular, 12pt, Sans-serif
- Use color coding: red for "before", purple for "process", green for "after"

**ANNOTATIONS:**
- Small callout bubble pointing to ML Context Optimizer: "50-70% reduction through TF-IDF semantic analysis"
- Small callout bubble pointing to Modular Architecture: "On-demand loading prevents token waste"

**DIMENSIONS:**
- Width: 1920px
- Height: 1080px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- High DPI: 300 DPI for print quality

**STYLE:**
- Clean, modern, professional technical diagram
- Flat design with subtle depth (no heavy 3D effects)
- Inspired by AWS architecture diagrams and GitLab DevOps diagrams
- Use icons from professional icon sets (Feather Icons or Heroicons style)
- Ensure text is highly readable with good contrast ratios (WCAG AAA compliant)

## 💡 What This Diagram Shows

This diagram illustrates CORTEX's token optimization system that achieved a **97.2% reduction** in API token usage.

**Before (Left - Red):** 
Monolithic 74,047 token file loaded on every request. Cost: $2.22/request. Speed: 2-3 seconds. Maintenance: nightmare.

**Solution (Center - Purple):** 
Four-layer optimization: modular architecture, ML compression (TF-IDF), cache management, and smart context selection.

**After (Right - Green):** 
Streamlined 2,078 tokens loaded on demand. Cost: $0.06/request. Speed: 80ms. Maintenance: easy.

**Impact (Bottom - Blue):** 
97.2% token reduction, $25,920/year saved, 97% performance improvement.

**Key Point:** These are real production metrics from CORTEX, not estimates. The system uses 35x fewer tokens while maintaining full functionality.
