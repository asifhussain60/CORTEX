Implements 6 protection layers to prevent degradation of CORTEX intelligence:
1. Instinct Immutability - Tier 0 governance rules cannot be bypassed
2. Tier Boundary Protection - Data stored in correct tier
3. SOLID Compliance - No God Objects, proper separation
4. Hemisphere Specialization - Strategic vs tactical separation
5. Knowledge Quality - Pattern validation and confidence thresholds
6. Commit Integrity - Brain state files excluded from commits
