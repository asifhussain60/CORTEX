CORTEX Knowledge Archive - Personal Cross-Project Learning System

Your personal archive of proven solutions across all projects.

This module manages your knowledge archive - a persistent memory of:
- Successful patterns you've used
- Mistakes you've learned from (anti-patterns)
- PR decisions and their outcomes
- Solutions that worked (and didn't work)

Think of it as "collaborating with Future You" - capture knowledge once,
reuse it forever across all your projects.
