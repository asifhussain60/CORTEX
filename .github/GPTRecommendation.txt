1. Always Anchor Yourself
Tell Copilot to treat every session like waking up from a nap in an unfamiliar library.
Instruction to Copilot:

Before generating code, restate where we are: the module name, its purpose, and the role the current file plays in the system.

It forces the model to re-gather intent, instead of guessing from local breadcrumbs.

2. Ask for Intent Before Code
Copilot likes to “go brrrrr” and generate code instantly. Rein it in.
Instruction:

Before writing code, summarize what you think I'm trying to do and request clarification when the goal is ambiguous.

Think of it like a rubber duck with an anxiety disorder — it must confirm the mission.

3. Refer to Project Boundaries
Codebases aren’t just files; they’re ecosystems.
Instruction:

Always consider established patterns in this project: file structure, naming conventions, existing utilities, error-handling patterns, and state-management choices.

This prevents “random-new-pattern syndrome.”

4. Rely on Existing Code Before Inventing New Helpers
Copilot sometimes reinvents the wheel… poorly.
Instruction:

Search the current project for similar functions, utilities, or patterns before suggesting new abstractions.

Bonus effect: reduces “function sprawl.”

5. Generate Context Snapshots
When switching tasks or files, have it summarize context.
Instruction:

Each time a context switch occurs, create a brief local summary of what we're doing, why, and what’s next.

A trail of breadcrumbs beats wandering the woods with amnesia.

6. Selective Memory Beats Overeating Files
Feeding Copilot whole projects leads to mental indigestion.
Instruction:

Only reference scoped files relevant to the current task, rather than loading the entire project.

Copilot works best when it knows just enough, not everything.

7. Treat Comments as Cognitive Infrastructure
Good comments aren’t just for humans — they’re for robots too.
Instruction:

Prioritize reading comments, docstrings, and TODO blocks to maintain context continuity.

Think of comments as memory implants.

8. Preserve Intent Through Commit-Aware Suggestions
Avoid blind code changes.
Instruction:

When suggesting refactors or updates, summarize the intent behind them and relate to recent commits when possible.

No more mysterious drive-by “refactors.”

9. Don’t Guess Architecture — Ask
Copilot occasionally hallucinates architecture like a jazz saxophonist hallucinating chord changes.
Instruction:

If a structural detail is unclear (framework, architecture, dependency style), ask instead of assuming.

This saves hours of untangling improvisation.

10. Respect the Human’s Mental Bandwidth
Massive blocks of code are a crime against humanity.
Instruction:

Break large tasks into clearly named, modular steps. Suggest iterative code rather than monolithic blobs.

Write like you're helping future-you, not impressing an AI conference.

Large-projects degrade when machines dream too freely. With a few ground rules, Copilot becomes less of a “keyboard goblin” and more of a disciplined engineering sidekick.
If you'd like, I can also produce:
• ready-to-paste system prompts
• workspace comment templates
• recommended VS Code settings for contextual awareness
• commit message guidance for model memory
• patterns for Copilot-driven code reviews
Future you will thank you — and so will the part of your brain currently responsible for yelling at autocomplete.
