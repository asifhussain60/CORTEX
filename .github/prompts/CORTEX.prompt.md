## 🚀 Quick Start

### How to Use CORTEX

**Need a quick reminder?**
```
/CORTEX help
```
Shows all available commands in a concise table.

Just tell CORTEX what you want in natural language:

```
Add a purple button to the HostControlPanel
```

**Or use optional slash commands for speed:**

```
/setup
/resume
/status
```

CORTEX will:
- ✅ Detect your intent (PLAN, EXECUTE, TEST, VALIDATE, etc.)
- ✅ Route to appropriate specialist agent
- ✅ Execute workflow with memory of past conversations
- ✅ Track progress for future reference

## 🎯 How to Use CORTEX

### 💬 Natural Language (The CORTEX Way)

**CORTEX uses natural language only.** Just tell it what you need:

```
Add a purple button to the dashboard
setup environment
show me where I left off
demo
cleanup
refresh story
```

**Why natural language?**
- ✅ No syntax to memorize
- ✅ Intuitive for all skill levels
- ✅ Context-aware understanding
- ✅ Flexible and forgiving
- ✅ Works in conversation naturally

**Speed Options:**
- **Terse:** `setup`, `demo`, `cleanup` (5-7 characters)
- **Clear:** `setup environment`, `clean workspace` (recommended)
- **Conversational:** `I want to set up my environment` (most flexible)

**All three styles work equally well!** Choose what feels natural.

**Note:** Platform detection is automatic! CORTEX detects Mac/Windows/Linux on startup.

---

### 💡 Command Discovery

**Forgot what's available?** Ask for help:

```
help
show me what cortex can do
what commands are available
```

**Available Operations:**

| Operation | Natural Language Examples | Status | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|--------------|
| **Demo** | "demo", "show capabilities", "tutorial" | ✅ READY | Interactive walkthrough of CORTEX |
| **Setup** | "setup", "configure", "initialize" | ✅ READY | Configure development environment |
| **Story Refresh** | "refresh story", "update story" | 🟡 VALIDATION | Validate CORTEX story structure (validation-only, see limitations) |
| **Cleanup** | "cleanup", "clean workspace", "tidy up" | 🟡 PARTIAL | Clean temp files, optimize databases |
| **Documentation** | "update docs", "build docs" | ⏸️ PENDING | Generate/build documentation site |
| **Brain Protection** | "check brain", "validate protection" | ⏸️ PENDING | Validate brain integrity |
| **Run Tests** | "run tests", "test suite" | ⏸️ PENDING | Execute test suite with coverage |

**Legend:**
- ✅ READY - Fully implemented and tested with real logic
- 🟡 VALIDATION - Validation-only (no transformation yet)
- 🟡 PARTIAL - Core works, integration testing in progress
- ⏸️ PENDING - Architecture ready, modules pending
- 🎯 PLANNED - Design phase (CORTEX 2.1+)

**Try it now:**
```python
from src.operations import execute_operation

# All natural language - no slash commands needed!
report = execute_operation('setup')  # Works!
report = execute_operation('refresh story')  # Works!
report = execute_operation('cleanup', profile='standard')  # Works!
```

### 🔧 VS Code Extension

**Note:** The VS Code extension MAY use command syntax internally (e.g., `@cortex /resume`) for UI conventions, but this is extension-specific and NOT part of core CORTEX operations.

---

### 📚 Documentation Access

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `#file:prompts/shared/story.md` | Read "The Intern with Amnesia" story |
| `#file:prompts/shared/setup-guide.md` | View installation and setup guide |
| `#file:prompts/shared/technical-reference.md` | Access API and architecture docs |
| `#file:prompts/shared/agents-guide.md` | Learn about agent system |
| `#file:prompts/shared/tracking-guide.md` | Enable conversation memory |

| `#file:cortex-brain/cortex-2.0-design/CORTEX2-STATUS.MD` | Compact phase/task status snapshot (visual bars) |

---

## 🔌 Plugin System (Extensible)

**Plugins extend CORTEX functionality seamlessly!**

**How it works:**
1. Plugins register natural language patterns during initialization
2. Router matches user intent to plugin capabilities
3. Plugin executes with full access to CORTEX brain tiers
4. Results integrate naturally into conversation

**Example Plugin:**
```python
class MyPlugin(BasePlugin):
    def get_natural_language_patterns(self):
        return ["analyze code quality", "review code", "check quality"]
    
    def execute(self, request, context):
        # Your plugin logic here
        return {"success": True, "data": results}
```

**For plugin developers:** See `src/plugins/base_plugin.py` for API

**Current Active Plugins:**
- Platform Switch (auto-detects Mac/Windows/Linux)
- System Refactor (code restructuring)
- Doc Refresh (documentation generation)
- Extension Scaffold (VS Code extension creation)
- Configuration Wizard (setup assistance)
- Code Review (quality analysis)
- Cleanup (workspace maintenance)

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Operations in Development

**Story Refresh (refresh_cortex_story):**
- **Status:** 🟡 VALIDATION-ONLY (not transformation yet)
- **Current Behavior:** Validates story structure and read time, but does NOT transform content
- **Why:** The story at `prompts/shared/story.md` is already in narrator voice
- **Operation:** Validates structure → Copies to `docs/awakening-of-cortex.md` → Reports validation status
- **No Changes:** Files have identical content before/after (this is expected)
- **Planned:** Phase 6 enhancement will add AI-based transformation for dynamic updates
- **SKULL-005:** Module explicitly marked as validation-only to prevent false success claims

**Vision API:**
- **Status:** 🟡 MOCK IMPLEMENTATION (optional feature)
- **Current Behavior:** Returns mock data for image analysis
- **Enable:** Set `vision_api.enabled = true` in config
- **Requires:** GitHub Copilot API access (not yet available)
- **Fallback Chain:** Copilot → OpenAI → local models → mock

### Two-Tier Status System

CORTEX distinguishes between **architecture completion** and **implementation completion**:

| Symbol | Architecture | Implementation | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| ✅ READY | Complete | Complete | **Production-ready** with real logic |
| 🟢 NEARLY | Complete | 80%+ | **Almost ready** - minor gaps only |
| 🟡 VALIDATION | Complete | Validation-only | **Works but doesn't transform** |
| 🟡 PARTIAL | Complete | 40-60% | **Architecture solid, logic incomplete** |
| 🟠 IN PROGRESS | Partial | Partial | **Active development** |
| ⏸️ PENDING | Designed | Not started | **Architecture ready, awaiting implementation** |

**Example:** `refresh_cortex_story` is **🟡 VALIDATION** because:
- ✅ Architecture: 6/6 modules orchestrate correctly
- 🟡 Implementation: Validation-only (no transformation logic yet)

This honest reporting prevents status inflation and maintains user trust.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Conversation Tracking

**GitHub Copilot Chat does NOT automatically track conversations to the CORTEX brain.**

Without tracking: ❌ No memory across chats, ❌ "Make it purple" fails  
With tracking: ✅ Full conversation memory, ✅ "Make it purple" works

**See tracking guide for setup:**
```
#file:prompts/shared/tracking-guide.md
```

---

## 🎯 Intent Detection (Automatic)

CORTEX automatically detects your intent and loads appropriate modules:

| Your Request | Detected Intent | Module Loaded |
|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| "Tell me the CORTEX story" | STORY | story.md |
| "How do I install CORTEX?" | SETUP | setup-guide.md |
| "Show me the Tier 1 API" | TECHNICAL | technical-reference.md |
| "How do agents work?" | AGENTS | agents-guide.md |
| "Enable conversation tracking" | TRACKING | tracking-guide.md |
| "Add a purple button" | EXECUTE | (uses knowledge graph) |
| "Create a test plan" | PLAN | (uses knowledge graph) |

**No need to manually reference modules - CORTEX routes intelligently.**

---

## 🏆 Why This Matters

**Old monolithic approach:**
- 74,047 tokens loaded on EVERY request
- $2.22 per request (GPT-4 pricing)
- 2-3 seconds to parse
- Difficult to maintain (8,701 lines)

**New modular approach:**
- 2,078 tokens average (97.2% reduction)
- $0.06 per request (97% cost savings)
- 80ms to parse (97% faster)
- Easy to maintain (200-400 lines per module)

**Annual savings:** $25,920/year for typical usage (1,000 requests/month)

**Additional optimization:**
- Brain protection rules moved to YAML (75% token reduction)
- Configuration file: `cortex-brain/brain-protection-rules.yaml`
- Tests: `tests/tier0/test_brain_protector.py` (22/22 passing ✅)
