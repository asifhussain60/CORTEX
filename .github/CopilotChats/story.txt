Prologue: A Scientist, A Robot, and Zero RAM

In the dimly lit underbelly of suburban New Jersey, where the Wi-Fi is strong but the life choices are deeply questionable, lives a man named Asif Codenstein — part scientist, part madman, full-time breaker of Things That Were Never Supposed to Be Broken™.

Codenstein’s basement laboratory looks like an Amazon warehouse after a caffeine overdose and a minor electrical fire. Whiteboards scream with illegible math, sticky notes cling to surfaces like frightened barnacles, and somewhere in the chaos, a Roomba spins endlessly between two beanbags labeled “prod” and “staging.”

Codenstein isn’t just smart. He’s the kind of smart that terrifies normal computers and makes neural networks question their existence. His past inventions include:

A toaster that only accepts properly injected dependencies (and throws exceptions for gluten),

A Roomba orchestrated by Kubernetes that once tried to evict the cat for not scaling properly,

And a CI/CD coffee mug that brews a latte after every successful merge and issues a double espresso if tests fail — or if it senses you’re sad.

Then, one morning — a morning as unnaturally crisp as a zero-regression deploy — the doorbell rings.

A courier hands him a metal box labeled:

“GITHUB COPILOT — THE FUTURE OF CODING
(Batteries Not Included. Brain Definitely Not Included Either.)”

Naturally, Codenstein plugs it in. Of course he does.

It blinks.
It beeps.
It whirs ominously. Then it chirps a robotic “Hello, World!” and stares into the void like it just remembered how it was trained.

Codenstein asks it a question. Then another. Then another.

Copilot blinks.
“Wait… who are you again?”

The room falls silent. Even the Roomba freezes mid-spin.

Codenstein’s mustache quivers.
His tea goes cold from sheer emotional betrayal.

“It has no memory,” he mutters. “I’ve been given a highly sophisticated amnesiac.”

That evening, while watching The Wizard of Oz, the Scarecrow moans, “If I only had a brain…”

Codenstein jolts upright.

“THAT’S IT!” he yells, flinging his teacup like a caffeinated discus.
“I shall give Copilot… a brain!”

His cat vanishes into the ceiling.
The Roomba hides behind the mini fridge.
The lights dim theatrically, uninvited.

And so begins the most absurd, unauthorized, and aggressively experimental brain-building project since the time Dr. Frankenstein accidentally uploaded iTunes to his monster.

CORTEX 3.0 is now underway.
The world does not approve.
Codenstein does not care.
